2. Comparative Analysis

A. Christianity and Islam
Similarities Between Christianity and Islam

Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world and share many similarities and differences.People who follow the Islamic faith are called Muslims and there are around 2 billion Muslims in the world today.People who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ are called Christians and there are around 2.4 billion Christians in the world today.At first, it seems that the two religions are very different, but there are many similarities between Christianity and Islam. Both religions have a similar place of origin - which is in the Middle East. Christians believe Jesus, who is the son of God, was born in the Middle East in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago. Muslims believe Islam was founded over 1400 years ago in Makkah, which is known today as Saudi Arabia.

Christians and Muslims believe that there is only one God (unlike religions such as Hinduism). This means that both religions are monotheistic. Christians and Muslims believe that the word of their God was revealed to them through prophets and holy scriptures. Both Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus and that he performed miracles. For Christians, Jesus is the son of God, whereas for Muslims, Jesus is one of many prophets. In Islam, Jesus is known as the Prophet Eesa Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH).

Another similarity between Christianity and Islam is that both religions are Abrahamic religions - meaning that they descended from Judaism and the worship of the God of Abraham. As well as this, both religions trace their origins to the two sons of Abraham. For Jewish people and Christians, it is his second son Isaac, but for Muslims, it is his eldest son, the Prophet Isma’il (PBUH).

What Are the Differences between Christianity and Islam?
There are many differences between the two religions. Here you can find the main differences:

A key difference is that Christianity is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow this are called Christians. Whereas, Muslims believe that the word of God and the teachings of Islam are shared by the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is believed to be the final prophet who taught Allah’s law and revealed the Islamic faith through the angel Jibril.
Islam views Jesus as a messiah, sent to guide the children of Israel and a messenger of God, not the son of God. Whereas, Christians believe Jesus to be the messiah of the Hebrew scripture (a religious text) and the son of God. Muslims believe that Allah (God) passed messages down to Earth through prophets like Prophet Eesa and Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Them).
Muslims believe that all prophets should be respected, but not worshipped. The vital difference between both religions is that Muslims view Jesus (Prophet Eesa, PBUH) as a human prophet, and do not believe that he is the son of God.
Christianity and Islam also have different scriptures, which is another word for a religious text. Muslims follow the Qur’an, but Christians follow the Bible.
The religions have differing beliefs on the Holy Spirit. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is God, but Muslims believe the Holy Spirit is the angel Jibril.
Similarly, Christians believe in the Doctrine of the Trinity. This means that God exists simultaneously as The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. In Islam, plurality of God would be seen as a denial of the belief of one God - Allah.
