# My-Comprehensive-Report-On-Major-Religions
I used Ai to get the appropriate structure and i then used Google to gather facts and relevant informations to create this report.

**1. Introduction**

**Overview of Major World Religions:** The world’s primary religions fall into two categories: Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; and Indian religions, which include Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and others. Of the world’s major religions, Christianity is the largest, with more than two billion followers.

**Objective:** The purpose of this report is to analyze the similarities and differences between the selected religions.Then get thorough analysis and doctrines.Also cultural impacts,rituals and practices is essential.The report  also touches on other mainline religions.

**2. Comparative Analysis**

**A. Christianity and Islam**
**Similarities Between Christianity and Islam**

Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world and share many similarities and differences.People who follow the Islamic faith are called Muslims and there are around 2 billion Muslims in the world today.People who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ are called Christians and there are around 2.4 billion Christians in the world today.At first, it seems that the two religions are very different, but there are many similarities between Christianity and Islam. Both religions have a similar place of origin - which is in the Middle East. Christians believe Jesus, who is the son of God, was born in the Middle East in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago. Muslims believe Islam was founded over 1400 years ago in Makkah, which is known today as Saudi Arabia.

Christians and Muslims believe that there is only one God (unlike religions such as Hinduism). This means that both religions are monotheistic. Christians and Muslims believe that the word of their God was revealed to them through prophets and holy scriptures. Both Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus and that he performed miracles. For Christians, Jesus is the son of God, whereas for Muslims, Jesus is one of many prophets. In Islam, Jesus is known as the Prophet Eesa Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH).

Another similarity between Christianity and Islam is that both religions are Abrahamic religions - meaning that they descended from Judaism and the worship of the God of Abraham. As well as this, both religions trace their origins to the two sons of Abraham. For Jewish people and Christians, it is his second son Isaac, but for Muslims, it is his eldest son, the Prophet Isma’il (PBUH).

**What Are the Differences between Christianity and Islam?**
There are many differences between the two religions. Here you can find the main differences:

A key difference is that Christianity is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow this are called Christians. Whereas, Muslims believe that the word of God and the teachings of Islam are shared by the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is believed to be the final prophet who taught Allah’s law and revealed the Islamic faith through the angel Jibril.
Islam views Jesus as a messiah, sent to guide the children of Israel and a messenger of God, not the son of God. Whereas, Christians believe Jesus to be the messiah of the Hebrew scripture (a religious text) and the son of God. Muslims believe that Allah (God) passed messages down to Earth through prophets like Prophet Eesa and Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Them).
Muslims believe that all prophets should be respected, but not worshipped. The vital difference between both religions is that Muslims view Jesus (Prophet Eesa, PBUH) as a human prophet, and do not believe that he is the son of God.
Christianity and Islam also have different scriptures, which is another word for a religious text. Muslims follow the Qur’an, but Christians follow the Bible.
The religions have differing beliefs on the Holy Spirit. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is God, but Muslims believe the Holy Spirit is the angel Jibril.
Similarly, Christians believe in the Doctrine of the Trinity. This means that God exists simultaneously as The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. In Islam, plurality of God would be seen as a denial of the belief of one God - Allah.

**Beliefs and Doctrines:**

**Christianity:** Indirectly or directly, Jesus and his Apostles left their principal—though perhaps not their only—records in the writings of the New Testament, the canonical texts that form the second part of the Christian Bible, which also includes the Hebrew Scriptures, or (in the Christian view) the Old Testament. The basic meaning of the term doctrine is “teaching.” Christian doctrine, accordingly, is the attempt to state in intellectually responsible terms the message of the gospel and the content of the faith it elicits. The doctrine, therefore, encompasses both the substance of what is taught and the act of setting that substance forth. While a certain reticence is appropriate in the face of the transcendent mystery of God, Christians hold that God has revealed himself sufficiently to allow and require truthful speech about him and his ways. Thus, Christian talk of God claims to be a response to the divine initiative, not simply a record of humanly generated experience. As Hilary of Poitiers wrote in the mid-4th century in his On the Trinity (IV.4), “God is to be believed when he speaks of himself, and whatever he grants us to think concerning himself is to be followed.”

From the first, church teaching has occurred in several contexts and for several purposes: it happens when the gospel is newly preached to people who have not heard it before (evangelism), when those who accept the message are instructed in preparation for baptism (catechesis), when the believing and baptized communities gather for worship (liturgy), and when application is sought to daily life (ethics). Teaching may be specially required for the sake of clarification and consolidation, as when distortions threaten within (aversion of heresy), when the faith is under attack from outside (apologetics), when linguistic or epistemological shifts over time hinder intelligibility or change the terms of reference (restatement), or when geographical expansion prompts a more local expression (inculturation). The teaching may vary in the weight of the authority it claims and is granted, ranging from the most solemn definitions of supervisory bodies (dogma) through a broadly prevalent but internally somewhat differentiated “common mind” (consensus) to the works of individual thinkers (theology).

The most stable and widely recognized teaching is that preserved in the ancient creeds—the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed—that are transmitted in the worship of the churches and expounded in their confessions (symbolics). The agreed doctrine may sometimes have been achieved only through a period of maturing reflection and debate, and the continuation of these processes within the established parameters is not excluded (development). In the course of history, however, differences concerning accepted teaching sometimes became so serious that communities divided over them (schism). The divided communities may continue their conversation in tones that range from the persuasive to the polemical (controversy). In the 20th century, determined efforts on the part of several Christian communions were made to overcome the doctrinal differences between them with the aim of restoring ecclesiastical unity (ecumenism).

Thus, there are many aspects to the question of Christian doctrine, and in what follows they will be treated in the sequence just outlined: the permanent basis, the perennial functions, the levels of authority, the stable pattern, and the institutional vicissitudes.

In his First Letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul summarized the gospel he himself had received and then preached to them, in which they now stood for their salvation: “that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures [that is, the Old Testament], and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve” (15:1–8). The speeches in the Acts of the Apostles are the basis of the following synthesis, by the biblical scholar C.H. Dodd, of the early apostolic preaching, or kerygma (from the Greek term for a herald’s proclamation).

**Islam:** The doctrine about God in the Qurʾān is rigorously monotheistic: God is one and unique; he has no partner and no equal. Trinitarianism, the Christian belief that God is three persons in one substance, is vigorously repudiated. Muslims believe that there are no intermediaries between God and the creation that he brought into being by his sheer command, “Be.” Although his presence is believed to be everywhere, he is not incarnated in anything. He is the sole creator and sustainer of the universe, wherein every creature bears witness to his unity and lordship. But he is also just and merciful: his justice ensures order in his creation, in which nothing is believed to be out of place, and his mercy is unbounded and encompasses everything. His creating and ordering the universe is viewed as the act of prime mercy for which all things sing his glories. The God of the Qurʾān, described as majestic and sovereign, is also a personal God; he is viewed as being nearer to one than one’s own jugular vein, and, whenever a person in need or distress calls him, he responds. Above all, he is the God of guidance and shows everything, particularly humanity, the right way, “the straight path.”

This picture of God—wherein the attributes of power, justice, and mercy interpenetrate—is related to the concept of God shared by Judaism and Christianity and also differs radically from the concepts of pagan Arabia, to which it provided an effective answer. The pagan Arabs believed in a blind and inexorable fate over which humans had no control. For this powerful but insensible fate the Qurān substituted a powerful but provident and merciful God. The Qurʾān carried through its uncompromising monotheism by rejecting all forms of idolatry and eliminating all gods and divinities that the Arabs worshipped in their sanctuaries (ḥarams), the most prominent of which was the Kaʿbah sanctuary in Mecca itself.

In order to prove the unity of God, the Qurʾān lays frequent stress on the design and order in the universe. There are no gaps or dislocations in nature. Order is explained by the fact that every created thing is endowed with a definite and defined nature whereby it falls into a pattern. This nature, though it allows every created thing to function in a whole, sets limits, and this idea of the limitedness of everything is one of the most fixed points in both the cosmology and theology of the Qurān. The universe is viewed, therefore, as autonomous, in the sense that everything has its own inherent laws of behaviour, but not as autocratic, because the patterns of behaviour have been endowed by God and are strictly limited. “Everything has been created by us according to a measure.” Though every creature is thus limited and “measured out” and hence depends upon God, God alone, who reigns unchallenged in the heavens and the earth, is unlimited, independent, and self-sufficient.

According to the Qurān, God created two apparently parallel species of creatures, human beings and jinn, the one from clay and the other from fire. About the jinn, however, the Qurʾān says little, although it is implied that the jinn are endowed with reason and responsibility but are more prone to evil than human beings are. It is with humanity that the Qurʾān, which describes itself as a guide for the human race, is centrally concerned. The story of the Fall of Adam (the first man) promoted in Judaism and Christianity is accepted, but the Qurʾān states that God forgave Adam his act of disobedience, which is not viewed in the Qurʾān as original sin in the Christian sense of the term.

In the story of the creation of humanity, Iblīs, or Satan, who protested to God against the creation of human beings, because they “would sow mischief on earth,” lost in the competition of knowledge against Adam. The Qurʾān, therefore, declares humanity to be the noblest of all creation, the created being who bore the trust (of responsibility) that the rest of creation refused to accept. The Qurʾān thus reiterates that all nature has been made subservient to humans, who are seen as God’s vice-regent on earth; nothing in all creation has been made without a purpose, and humanity itself has not been created “in sport” but rather has been created with the purpose of serving and obeying God’s will.

Despite this lofty station, however, the Qurʾān describes human nature as frail and faltering. Whereas everything in the universe has a limited nature and every creature recognizes its limitation and insufficiency, human beings are viewed as having been given freedom and therefore are prone to rebelliousness and pride, with the tendency to arrogate to themselves the attributes of self-sufficiency. Pride, thus, is viewed as the cardinal sin of human beings, because, by not recognizing in themselves their essential creaturely limitations, they become guilty of ascribing to themselves partnership with God (shirk: associating a creature with the Creator) and of violating the unity of God. True faith (īmān), thus, consists of belief in the immaculate Divine Unity and islām (surrender) in one’s submission to the Divine Will.


**Cultural Impacts:**

**Christianity's Influence On Western Art**, philosophy, education, and law.
The roots of Christian art and architecture can be traced back to the early centuries of the Common Era when the Christian faith began to spread throughout the Roman Empire. During this period, Christians often practiced their faith in secret due to persecution, leading to the development of the catacombs—underground burial sites that also served as places of worship. The art found in these catacombs provides some of the earliest examples of Christian iconography, with simple frescoes depicting biblical scenes, symbols like the fish (Ichthys), and the Good Shepherd.

As Christianity gained acceptance with Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in 313 AD, it moved from hidden worship to more public and monumental forms. The construction of basilicas, such as the Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, marked the beginning of Christian architectural influence. These structures, characterized by their large interior spaces and nave-and-aisle design, provided a model for future Christian churches.

The Byzantine Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), became a center of Christian art and architecture from the 4th to the 15th centuries. Byzantine art is renowned for its use of mosaics, gold, and vibrant colors, reflecting the divine light and heavenly glory. The gold Orthodox cross became a prominent symbol in Byzantine churches, signifying the glory of Christ and the spiritual wealth of the church.

Byzantine architecture is exemplified by the Hagia Sophia, a marvel of engineering and design with its massive dome and intricate mosaics. The use of domes in Christian architecture symbolized the heavens, while the mosaics often depicted Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and biblical scenes, serving both decorative and didactic purposes. Icons also played a significant role in Byzantine worship, providing visual representations of sacred figures that aided the faithful in their devotion.

The Romanesque period (roughly 9th to 12th centuries) saw the construction of solid, fortress-like churches with rounded arches, thick walls, and small windows. These structures, such as the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis in France, were designed to convey the strength and permanence of the Christian faith. Romanesque art often featured biblical scenes, saints, and the Last Judgment, carved into stone portals and capitals.

The Gothic era (12th to 16th centuries) marked a significant shift in Christian architecture, emphasizing verticality and light. Gothic cathedrals, like Chartres Cathedral and Notre-Dame de Paris, featured pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, allowing for taller structures and larger windows. Stained glass became a hallmark of Gothic architecture, depicting biblical stories and saints in vibrant colors that filled the interior with light, symbolizing the presence of God. The use of light, space, and height in Gothic architecture aimed to inspire awe and lift the soul toward the divine.

In the modern era, Christian art and architecture continue to evolve, reflecting contemporary styles and theological ideas. Modern churches often blend traditional elements with innovative designs, using materials like concrete and steel. Architects like Le Corbusier and Antoni Gaudí have contributed to the modern Christian architectural landscape with works like the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in France and the Sagrada Família in Spain, which combine abstract forms with religious symbolism.

The Reformation in the 16th century led to a shift in religious art, especially in Protestant regions, where the focus moved away from elaborate church decorations and icons. Protestant reformers emphasized the simplicity of worship and the centrality of the Bible, leading to plainer church interiors. However, in Catholic regions, the Counter-Reformation inspired the Baroque style, characterized by dramatic, emotional art and architecture designed to evoke spiritual experience and devotion.

Contemporary Christian art also engages with modern themes and concerns, addressing issues like social justice, environmental stewardship, and interfaith dialogue. Christian artists continue to explore new ways of expressing their faith through visual arts, using a wide range of media and styles.

Christianity's influence on Western art and architecture is profound and enduring, shaping cultural and artistic expressions for centuries. From the early catacombs to modern church designs, Christian art and architecture have evolved, reflecting theological developments, cultural shifts, and artistic innovations.

**Christianity's Influence On Philosophy**
Christian philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Christians, or in relation to the religion of Christianity. Christian philosophy emerged with the aim of reconciling science and faith, starting from natural rational explanations with the help of Christian revelation. Several thinkers such as Origen of Alexandria and Augustine believed that there was a harmonious relationship between science and faith, others such as Tertullian claimed that there was contradiction and others tried to differentiate them.[1]

There are scholars who question the existence of a Christian philosophy itself. These claim that there is no originality in Christian thought and its concepts and ideas are inherited from Greek philosophy. Thus, Christian philosophy would protect philosophical thought, which would already be definitively elaborated by Greek philosophy.[2]

However, Boehner and Gilson claim that Christian philosophy is not a simple repetition of ancient philosophy, although they owe to Greek science the knowledge developed by Plato, Aristotle and the Neo-Platonists. They even claim that in Christian philosophy, Greek culture survives in organic form.[3]

In the early days when people began to get converted to Christianity there were not many Christians that were well educated. But by the third century there were Greek Christians who were sizeably intellectual and educated in the philosophy of the day. When they tried to engage in preaching the Christian gospel and apologetics with their fellow citizens who were also intellectuals, they frequently used the categories of Greek thought and philosophy in order to explain their beliefs. That happened, notoriously so, in the attempts of the church fathers to explain how Jesus could be both man and God simultaneously. If you look at the explanations they give and the terms they use, they are the terms borrowed from Aristotelian philosophy and so forth. They were the only categories of thought open to them at the time, if they wanted to be philosophical.

Some of the Greek philosophers were fatalists, the Stoics for instance. Stoicism commended itself to many, and to Romans in particular, as being a manly faith. They couldn't accept Epicureanism, which, among other things, made the whole universe—man included—depend upon chance. Stoics were more fatalists. It is not surprising, therefore, that medieval schoolmen and even the Reformers (whose education was firstly in classical philosophies and classical languages, and then in theology) took some of their concepts of God from Greek philosophy. Some of the fatalism that lies behind extreme forms of Calvinism owes a tremendous lot, in my humble estimation, to the influence of the fatalism of Greek philosophy on men like Calvin, who were first students of Greek philosophy before they became believers and then theologians.

If you want a clear example of that kind of thing, you could take the question whether it is possible for God to suffer. It has only been comparatively recently—within my lifetime—that Christian theologians have been willing to admit that God the Father can suffer. They held steadfastly over many centuries that God was impassible, meaning that God can't suffer. They argued, therefore, that God experiences no emotion, because emotion implies change, and God is utterly unchangeable. He is, they said, supreme perfection. If he changed for the better he wasn't perfect to start with; if he changed for the worse he was no longer perfect. And since emotions imply a change in you, from being calm to being emotional, God cannot experience emotion. And it went down the centuries, until recent times, in Christian theology that God cannot suffer, and you would be told it would be wrong to say that at Calvary the Father suffered anything. Only Jesus could suffer, because he was human.

I don't know how Christian theologians could ever have thought that was true, when they had the whole of the Old Testament saying the very opposite: 'God is angry with sinners every day' (Psalm 7:11); 'In all their affliction he was afflicted' (Isaiah 63:9). The God of the Old Testament is no Aristotelian god of Greek philosophy. He happens to be the true God. You don't suppose that when God the Father saw his son hanging upon Calvary he sat upon his throne unmoved, do you? Greek philosophy has so influenced Christian theologians that, for many centuries, they held that God was utterly impassible. We now see, of course, that is wrong.

If we have studied a great deal of Greek philosophy, we need to make sure that the God we worship is not one described in terms of Greek philosophy. The God we serve is, excuse the term, a Christian God. If you want to know what God is like, God is like Jesus Christ, his Son.
