# My-Comprehensive-Report-On-Major-Religions
I used Ai to get the appropriate structure and i then used Google to gather facts and relevant informations to create this report.

**1. Introduction**

**Overview of Major World Religions:** The world’s primary religions fall into two categories: Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; and Indian religions, which include Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and others. Of the world’s major religions, Christianity is the largest, with more than two billion followers.

**Objective:** The purpose of this report is to analyze the similarities and differences between the selected religions.Then get thorough analysis and doctrines.Also cultural impacts,rituals and practices is essential.The report  also touches on other mainline religions.

**2. Comparative Analysis**

**A. Christianity and Islam**
Similarities Between Christianity and Islam

Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world and share many similarities and differences.People who follow the Islamic faith are called Muslims and there are around 2 billion Muslims in the world today.People who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ are called Christians and there are around 2.4 billion Christians in the world today.At first, it seems that the two religions are very different, but there are many similarities between Christianity and Islam. Both religions have a similar place of origin - which is in the Middle East. Christians believe Jesus, who is the son of God, was born in the Middle East in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago. Muslims believe Islam was founded over 1400 years ago in Makkah, which is known today as Saudi Arabia.

Christians and Muslims believe that there is only one God (unlike religions such as Hinduism). This means that both religions are monotheistic. Christians and Muslims believe that the word of their God was revealed to them through prophets and holy scriptures. Both Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus and that he performed miracles. For Christians, Jesus is the son of God, whereas for Muslims, Jesus is one of many prophets. In Islam, Jesus is known as the Prophet Eesa Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH).

Another similarity between Christianity and Islam is that both religions are Abrahamic religions - meaning that they descended from Judaism and the worship of the God of Abraham. As well as this, both religions trace their origins to the two sons of Abraham. For Jewish people and Christians, it is his second son Isaac, but for Muslims, it is his eldest son, the Prophet Isma’il (PBUH).

**What Are the Differences between Christianity and Islam?**
There are many differences between the two religions. Here you can find the main differences:

A key difference is that Christianity is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow this are called Christians. Whereas, Muslims believe that the word of God and the teachings of Islam are shared by the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is believed to be the final prophet who taught Allah’s law and revealed the Islamic faith through the angel Jibril.
Islam views Jesus as a messiah, sent to guide the children of Israel and a messenger of God, not the son of God. Whereas, Christians believe Jesus to be the messiah of the Hebrew scripture (a religious text) and the son of God. Muslims believe that Allah (God) passed messages down to Earth through prophets like Prophet Eesa and Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Them).
Muslims believe that all prophets should be respected, but not worshipped. The vital difference between both religions is that Muslims view Jesus (Prophet Eesa, PBUH) as a human prophet, and do not believe that he is the son of God.
Christianity and Islam also have different scriptures, which is another word for a religious text. Muslims follow the Qur’an, but Christians follow the Bible.
The religions have differing beliefs on the Holy Spirit. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is God, but Muslims believe the Holy Spirit is the angel Jibril.
Similarly, Christians believe in the Doctrine of the Trinity. This means that God exists simultaneously as The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. In Islam, plurality of God would be seen as a denial of the belief of one God - Allah.

**Beliefs and Doctrines:**

**Christianity:** Indirectly or directly, Jesus and his Apostles left their principal—though perhaps not their only—records in the writings of the New Testament, the canonical texts that form the second part of the Christian Bible, which also includes the Hebrew Scriptures, or (in the Christian view) the Old Testament. The basic meaning of the term doctrine is “teaching.” Christian doctrine, accordingly, is the attempt to state in intellectually responsible terms the message of the gospel and the content of the faith it elicits. The doctrine, therefore, encompasses both the substance of what is taught and the act of setting that substance forth. While a certain reticence is appropriate in the face of the transcendent mystery of God, Christians hold that God has revealed himself sufficiently to allow and require truthful speech about him and his ways. Thus, Christian talk of God claims to be a response to the divine initiative, not simply a record of humanly generated experience. As Hilary of Poitiers wrote in the mid-4th century in his On the Trinity (IV.4), “God is to be believed when he speaks of himself, and whatever he grants us to think concerning himself is to be followed.”

From the first, church teaching has occurred in several contexts and for several purposes: it happens when the gospel is newly preached to people who have not heard it before (evangelism), when those who accept the message are instructed in preparation for baptism (catechesis), when the believing and baptized communities gather for worship (liturgy), and when application is sought to daily life (ethics). Teaching may be specially required for the sake of clarification and consolidation, as when distortions threaten within (aversion of heresy), when the faith is under attack from outside (apologetics), when linguistic or epistemological shifts over time hinder intelligibility or change the terms of reference (restatement), or when geographical expansion prompts a more local expression (inculturation). The teaching may vary in the weight of the authority it claims and is granted, ranging from the most solemn definitions of supervisory bodies (dogma) through a broadly prevalent but internally somewhat differentiated “common mind” (consensus) to the works of individual thinkers (theology).

The most stable and widely recognized teaching is that preserved in the ancient creeds—the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed—that are transmitted in the worship of the churches and expounded in their confessions (symbolics). The agreed doctrine may sometimes have been achieved only through a period of maturing reflection and debate, and the continuation of these processes within the established parameters is not excluded (development). In the course of history, however, differences concerning accepted teaching sometimes became so serious that communities divided over them (schism). The divided communities may continue their conversation in tones that range from the persuasive to the polemical (controversy). In the 20th century, determined efforts on the part of several Christian communions were made to overcome the doctrinal differences between them with the aim of restoring ecclesiastical unity (ecumenism).

Thus, there are many aspects to the question of Christian doctrine, and in what follows they will be treated in the sequence just outlined: the permanent basis, the perennial functions, the levels of authority, the stable pattern, and the institutional vicissitudes.

In his First Letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul summarized the gospel he himself had received and then preached to them, in which they now stood for their salvation: “that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures [that is, the Old Testament], and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve” (15:1–8). The speeches in the Acts of the Apostles are the basis of the following synthesis, by the biblical scholar C.H. Dodd, of the early apostolic preaching, or kerygma (from the Greek term for a herald’s proclamation).

**Islam:** The doctrine about God in the Qurʾān is rigorously monotheistic: God is one and unique; he has no partner and no equal. Trinitarianism, the Christian belief that God is three persons in one substance, is vigorously repudiated. Muslims believe that there are no intermediaries between God and the creation that he brought into being by his sheer command, “Be.” Although his presence is believed to be everywhere, he is not incarnated in anything. He is the sole creator and sustainer of the universe, wherein every creature bears witness to his unity and lordship. But he is also just and merciful: his justice ensures order in his creation, in which nothing is believed to be out of place, and his mercy is unbounded and encompasses everything. His creating and ordering the universe is viewed as the act of prime mercy for which all things sing his glories. The God of the Qurʾān, described as majestic and sovereign, is also a personal God; he is viewed as being nearer to one than one’s own jugular vein, and, whenever a person in need or distress calls him, he responds. Above all, he is the God of guidance and shows everything, particularly humanity, the right way, “the straight path.”

This picture of God—wherein the attributes of power, justice, and mercy interpenetrate—is related to the concept of God shared by Judaism and Christianity and also differs radically from the concepts of pagan Arabia, to which it provided an effective answer. The pagan Arabs believed in a blind and inexorable fate over which humans had no control. For this powerful but insensible fate the Qurān substituted a powerful but provident and merciful God. The Qurʾān carried through its uncompromising monotheism by rejecting all forms of idolatry and eliminating all gods and divinities that the Arabs worshipped in their sanctuaries (ḥarams), the most prominent of which was the Kaʿbah sanctuary in Mecca itself.

In order to prove the unity of God, the Qurʾān lays frequent stress on the design and order in the universe. There are no gaps or dislocations in nature. Order is explained by the fact that every created thing is endowed with a definite and defined nature whereby it falls into a pattern. This nature, though it allows every created thing to function in a whole, sets limits, and this idea of the limitedness of everything is one of the most fixed points in both the cosmology and theology of the Qurān. The universe is viewed, therefore, as autonomous, in the sense that everything has its own inherent laws of behaviour, but not as autocratic, because the patterns of behaviour have been endowed by God and are strictly limited. “Everything has been created by us according to a measure.” Though every creature is thus limited and “measured out” and hence depends upon God, God alone, who reigns unchallenged in the heavens and the earth, is unlimited, independent, and self-sufficient.
