# My-Comprehensive-Report-On-Major-Religions
I used Ai to get the appropriate structure and i then used Google to gather facts and relevant informations to create this report.

**1. Introduction**

**Overview of Major World Religions:** The world’s primary religions fall into two categories: Abrahamic religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; and Indian religions, which include Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and others. Of the world’s major religions, Christianity is the largest, with more than two billion followers.

**Objective:** The purpose of this report is to analyze the similarities and differences between the selected religions.Then get thorough analysis and doctrines.Also cultural impacts,rituals and practices is essential.The report  also touches on other mainline religions.

**2. Comparative Analysis**

**A. Christianity and Islam**

**Similarities Between Christianity and Islam**

Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world and share many similarities and differences.People who follow the Islamic faith are called Muslims and there are around 2 billion Muslims in the world today.People who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ are called Christians and there are around 2.4 billion Christians in the world today.At first, it seems that the two religions are very different, but there are many similarities between Christianity and Islam. Both religions have a similar place of origin - which is in the Middle East. Christians believe Jesus, who is the son of God, was born in the Middle East in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago. Muslims believe Islam was founded over 1400 years ago in Makkah, which is known today as Saudi Arabia.

Christians and Muslims believe that there is only one God (unlike religions such as Hinduism). This means that both religions are monotheistic. Christians and Muslims believe that the word of their God was revealed to them through prophets and holy scriptures. Both Christians and Muslims believe in Jesus and that he performed miracles. For Christians, Jesus is the son of God, whereas for Muslims, Jesus is one of many prophets. In Islam, Jesus is known as the Prophet Eesa Peace Be Upon Him (PBUH).

Another similarity between Christianity and Islam is that both religions are Abrahamic religions - meaning that they descended from Judaism and the worship of the God of Abraham. As well as this, both religions trace their origins to the two sons of Abraham. For Jewish people and Christians, it is his second son Isaac, but for Muslims, it is his eldest son, the Prophet Isma’il (PBUH).

**What Are the Differences between Christianity and Islam?**

There are many differences between the two religions. Here you can find the main differences:

A key difference is that Christianity is founded on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and those who follow this are called Christians. Whereas, Muslims believe that the word of God and the teachings of Islam are shared by the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is believed to be the final prophet who taught Allah’s law and revealed the Islamic faith through the angel Jibril.
Islam views Jesus as a messiah, sent to guide the children of Israel and a messenger of God, not the son of God. Whereas, Christians believe Jesus to be the messiah of the Hebrew scripture (a religious text) and the son of God. Muslims believe that Allah (God) passed messages down to Earth through prophets like Prophet Eesa and Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Them).
Muslims believe that all prophets should be respected, but not worshipped. The vital difference between both religions is that Muslims view Jesus (Prophet Eesa, PBUH) as a human prophet, and do not believe that he is the son of God.
Christianity and Islam also have different scriptures, which is another word for a religious text. Muslims follow the Qur’an, but Christians follow the Bible.
The religions have differing beliefs on the Holy Spirit. Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is God, but Muslims believe the Holy Spirit is the angel Jibril.
Similarly, Christians believe in the Doctrine of the Trinity. This means that God exists simultaneously as The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. In Islam, plurality of God would be seen as a denial of the belief of one God - Allah.

**Beliefs and Doctrines:**

**Christianity:** Indirectly or directly, Jesus and his Apostles left their principal—though perhaps not their only—records in the writings of the New Testament, the canonical texts that form the second part of the Christian Bible, which also includes the Hebrew Scriptures, or (in the Christian view) the Old Testament. The basic meaning of the term doctrine is “teaching.” Christian doctrine, accordingly, is the attempt to state in intellectually responsible terms the message of the gospel and the content of the faith it elicits. The doctrine, therefore, encompasses both the substance of what is taught and the act of setting that substance forth. While a certain reticence is appropriate in the face of the transcendent mystery of God, Christians hold that God has revealed himself sufficiently to allow and require truthful speech about him and his ways. Thus, Christian talk of God claims to be a response to the divine initiative, not simply a record of humanly generated experience. As Hilary of Poitiers wrote in the mid-4th century in his On the Trinity (IV.4), “God is to be believed when he speaks of himself, and whatever he grants us to think concerning himself is to be followed.”

From the first, church teaching has occurred in several contexts and for several purposes: it happens when the gospel is newly preached to people who have not heard it before (evangelism), when those who accept the message are instructed in preparation for baptism (catechesis), when the believing and baptized communities gather for worship (liturgy), and when application is sought to daily life (ethics). Teaching may be specially required for the sake of clarification and consolidation, as when distortions threaten within (aversion of heresy), when the faith is under attack from outside (apologetics), when linguistic or epistemological shifts over time hinder intelligibility or change the terms of reference (restatement), or when geographical expansion prompts a more local expression (inculturation). The teaching may vary in the weight of the authority it claims and is granted, ranging from the most solemn definitions of supervisory bodies (dogma) through a broadly prevalent but internally somewhat differentiated “common mind” (consensus) to the works of individual thinkers (theology).

The most stable and widely recognized teaching is that preserved in the ancient creeds—the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed—that are transmitted in the worship of the churches and expounded in their confessions (symbolics). The agreed doctrine may sometimes have been achieved only through a period of maturing reflection and debate, and the continuation of these processes within the established parameters is not excluded (development). In the course of history, however, differences concerning accepted teaching sometimes became so serious that communities divided over them (schism). The divided communities may continue their conversation in tones that range from the persuasive to the polemical (controversy). In the 20th century, determined efforts on the part of several Christian communions were made to overcome the doctrinal differences between them with the aim of restoring ecclesiastical unity (ecumenism).

Thus, there are many aspects to the question of Christian doctrine, and in what follows they will be treated in the sequence just outlined: the permanent basis, the perennial functions, the levels of authority, the stable pattern, and the institutional vicissitudes.

In his First Letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul summarized the gospel he himself had received and then preached to them, in which they now stood for their salvation: “that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures [that is, the Old Testament], and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas [Peter], then to the twelve” (15:1–8). The speeches in the Acts of the Apostles are the basis of the following synthesis, by the biblical scholar C.H. Dodd, of the early apostolic preaching, or kerygma (from the Greek term for a herald’s proclamation).

**Islam:** The doctrine about God in the Qurʾān is rigorously monotheistic: God is one and unique; he has no partner and no equal. Trinitarianism, the Christian belief that God is three persons in one substance, is vigorously repudiated. Muslims believe that there are no intermediaries between God and the creation that he brought into being by his sheer command, “Be.” Although his presence is believed to be everywhere, he is not incarnated in anything. He is the sole creator and sustainer of the universe, wherein every creature bears witness to his unity and lordship. But he is also just and merciful: his justice ensures order in his creation, in which nothing is believed to be out of place, and his mercy is unbounded and encompasses everything. His creating and ordering the universe is viewed as the act of prime mercy for which all things sing his glories. The God of the Qurʾān, described as majestic and sovereign, is also a personal God; he is viewed as being nearer to one than one’s own jugular vein, and, whenever a person in need or distress calls him, he responds. Above all, he is the God of guidance and shows everything, particularly humanity, the right way, “the straight path.”

This picture of God—wherein the attributes of power, justice, and mercy interpenetrate—is related to the concept of God shared by Judaism and Christianity and also differs radically from the concepts of pagan Arabia, to which it provided an effective answer. The pagan Arabs believed in a blind and inexorable fate over which humans had no control. For this powerful but insensible fate the Qurān substituted a powerful but provident and merciful God. The Qurʾān carried through its uncompromising monotheism by rejecting all forms of idolatry and eliminating all gods and divinities that the Arabs worshipped in their sanctuaries (ḥarams), the most prominent of which was the Kaʿbah sanctuary in Mecca itself.

In order to prove the unity of God, the Qurʾān lays frequent stress on the design and order in the universe. There are no gaps or dislocations in nature. Order is explained by the fact that every created thing is endowed with a definite and defined nature whereby it falls into a pattern. This nature, though it allows every created thing to function in a whole, sets limits, and this idea of the limitedness of everything is one of the most fixed points in both the cosmology and theology of the Qurān. The universe is viewed, therefore, as autonomous, in the sense that everything has its own inherent laws of behaviour, but not as autocratic, because the patterns of behaviour have been endowed by God and are strictly limited. “Everything has been created by us according to a measure.” Though every creature is thus limited and “measured out” and hence depends upon God, God alone, who reigns unchallenged in the heavens and the earth, is unlimited, independent, and self-sufficient.

According to the Qurān, God created two apparently parallel species of creatures, human beings and jinn, the one from clay and the other from fire. About the jinn, however, the Qurʾān says little, although it is implied that the jinn are endowed with reason and responsibility but are more prone to evil than human beings are. It is with humanity that the Qurʾān, which describes itself as a guide for the human race, is centrally concerned. The story of the Fall of Adam (the first man) promoted in Judaism and Christianity is accepted, but the Qurʾān states that God forgave Adam his act of disobedience, which is not viewed in the Qurʾān as original sin in the Christian sense of the term.

In the story of the creation of humanity, Iblīs, or Satan, who protested to God against the creation of human beings, because they “would sow mischief on earth,” lost in the competition of knowledge against Adam. The Qurʾān, therefore, declares humanity to be the noblest of all creation, the created being who bore the trust (of responsibility) that the rest of creation refused to accept. The Qurʾān thus reiterates that all nature has been made subservient to humans, who are seen as God’s vice-regent on earth; nothing in all creation has been made without a purpose, and humanity itself has not been created “in sport” but rather has been created with the purpose of serving and obeying God’s will.

Despite this lofty station, however, the Qurʾān describes human nature as frail and faltering. Whereas everything in the universe has a limited nature and every creature recognizes its limitation and insufficiency, human beings are viewed as having been given freedom and therefore are prone to rebelliousness and pride, with the tendency to arrogate to themselves the attributes of self-sufficiency. Pride, thus, is viewed as the cardinal sin of human beings, because, by not recognizing in themselves their essential creaturely limitations, they become guilty of ascribing to themselves partnership with God (shirk: associating a creature with the Creator) and of violating the unity of God. True faith (īmān), thus, consists of belief in the immaculate Divine Unity and islām (surrender) in one’s submission to the Divine Will.


**Cultural Impacts:**

**Christianity's Influence On Western Art**

The roots of Christian art and architecture can be traced back to the early centuries of the Common Era when the Christian faith began to spread throughout the Roman Empire. During this period, Christians often practiced their faith in secret due to persecution, leading to the development of the catacombs—underground burial sites that also served as places of worship. The art found in these catacombs provides some of the earliest examples of Christian iconography, with simple frescoes depicting biblical scenes, symbols like the fish (Ichthys), and the Good Shepherd.

As Christianity gained acceptance with Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in 313 AD, it moved from hidden worship to more public and monumental forms. The construction of basilicas, such as the Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, marked the beginning of Christian architectural influence. These structures, characterized by their large interior spaces and nave-and-aisle design, provided a model for future Christian churches.

The Byzantine Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), became a center of Christian art and architecture from the 4th to the 15th centuries. Byzantine art is renowned for its use of mosaics, gold, and vibrant colors, reflecting the divine light and heavenly glory. The gold Orthodox cross became a prominent symbol in Byzantine churches, signifying the glory of Christ and the spiritual wealth of the church.

Byzantine architecture is exemplified by the Hagia Sophia, a marvel of engineering and design with its massive dome and intricate mosaics. The use of domes in Christian architecture symbolized the heavens, while the mosaics often depicted Christ, the Virgin Mary, saints, and biblical scenes, serving both decorative and didactic purposes. Icons also played a significant role in Byzantine worship, providing visual representations of sacred figures that aided the faithful in their devotion.

The Romanesque period (roughly 9th to 12th centuries) saw the construction of solid, fortress-like churches with rounded arches, thick walls, and small windows. These structures, such as the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis in France, were designed to convey the strength and permanence of the Christian faith. Romanesque art often featured biblical scenes, saints, and the Last Judgment, carved into stone portals and capitals.

The Gothic era (12th to 16th centuries) marked a significant shift in Christian architecture, emphasizing verticality and light. Gothic cathedrals, like Chartres Cathedral and Notre-Dame de Paris, featured pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses, allowing for taller structures and larger windows. Stained glass became a hallmark of Gothic architecture, depicting biblical stories and saints in vibrant colors that filled the interior with light, symbolizing the presence of God. The use of light, space, and height in Gothic architecture aimed to inspire awe and lift the soul toward the divine.

In the modern era, Christian art and architecture continue to evolve, reflecting contemporary styles and theological ideas. Modern churches often blend traditional elements with innovative designs, using materials like concrete and steel. Architects like Le Corbusier and Antoni Gaudí have contributed to the modern Christian architectural landscape with works like the Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in France and the Sagrada Família in Spain, which combine abstract forms with religious symbolism.

The Reformation in the 16th century led to a shift in religious art, especially in Protestant regions, where the focus moved away from elaborate church decorations and icons. Protestant reformers emphasized the simplicity of worship and the centrality of the Bible, leading to plainer church interiors. However, in Catholic regions, the Counter-Reformation inspired the Baroque style, characterized by dramatic, emotional art and architecture designed to evoke spiritual experience and devotion.

Contemporary Christian art also engages with modern themes and concerns, addressing issues like social justice, environmental stewardship, and interfaith dialogue. Christian artists continue to explore new ways of expressing their faith through visual arts, using a wide range of media and styles.

Christianity's influence on Western art and architecture is profound and enduring, shaping cultural and artistic expressions for centuries. From the early catacombs to modern church designs, Christian art and architecture have evolved, reflecting theological developments, cultural shifts, and artistic innovations.

**Christianity's Influence On Philosophy**

Christian philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Christians, or in relation to the religion of Christianity. Christian philosophy emerged with the aim of reconciling science and faith, starting from natural rational explanations with the help of Christian revelation. Several thinkers such as Origen of Alexandria and Augustine believed that there was a harmonious relationship between science and faith, others such as Tertullian claimed that there was contradiction and others tried to differentiate them.[1]

There are scholars who question the existence of a Christian philosophy itself. These claim that there is no originality in Christian thought and its concepts and ideas are inherited from Greek philosophy. Thus, Christian philosophy would protect philosophical thought, which would already be definitively elaborated by Greek philosophy.[2]

However, Boehner and Gilson claim that Christian philosophy is not a simple repetition of ancient philosophy, although they owe to Greek science the knowledge developed by Plato, Aristotle and the Neo-Platonists. They even claim that in Christian philosophy, Greek culture survives in organic form.[3]

In the early days when people began to get converted to Christianity there were not many Christians that were well educated. But by the third century there were Greek Christians who were sizeably intellectual and educated in the philosophy of the day. When they tried to engage in preaching the Christian gospel and apologetics with their fellow citizens who were also intellectuals, they frequently used the categories of Greek thought and philosophy in order to explain their beliefs. That happened, notoriously so, in the attempts of the church fathers to explain how Jesus could be both man and God simultaneously. If you look at the explanations they give and the terms they use, they are the terms borrowed from Aristotelian philosophy and so forth. They were the only categories of thought open to them at the time, if they wanted to be philosophical.

Some of the Greek philosophers were fatalists, the Stoics for instance. Stoicism commended itself to many, and to Romans in particular, as being a manly faith. They couldn't accept Epicureanism, which, among other things, made the whole universe—man included—depend upon chance. Stoics were more fatalists. It is not surprising, therefore, that medieval schoolmen and even the Reformers (whose education was firstly in classical philosophies and classical languages, and then in theology) took some of their concepts of God from Greek philosophy. Some of the fatalism that lies behind extreme forms of Calvinism owes a tremendous lot, in my humble estimation, to the influence of the fatalism of Greek philosophy on men like Calvin, who were first students of Greek philosophy before they became believers and then theologians.

If you want a clear example of that kind of thing, you could take the question whether it is possible for God to suffer. It has only been comparatively recently—within my lifetime—that Christian theologians have been willing to admit that God the Father can suffer. They held steadfastly over many centuries that God was impassible, meaning that God can't suffer. They argued, therefore, that God experiences no emotion, because emotion implies change, and God is utterly unchangeable. He is, they said, supreme perfection. If he changed for the better he wasn't perfect to start with; if he changed for the worse he was no longer perfect. And since emotions imply a change in you, from being calm to being emotional, God cannot experience emotion. And it went down the centuries, until recent times, in Christian theology that God cannot suffer, and you would be told it would be wrong to say that at Calvary the Father suffered anything. Only Jesus could suffer, because he was human.

I don't know how Christian theologians could ever have thought that was true, when they had the whole of the Old Testament saying the very opposite: 'God is angry with sinners every day' (Psalm 7:11); 'In all their affliction he was afflicted' (Isaiah 63:9). The God of the Old Testament is no Aristotelian god of Greek philosophy. He happens to be the true God. You don't suppose that when God the Father saw his son hanging upon Calvary he sat upon his throne unmoved, do you? Greek philosophy has so influenced Christian theologians that, for many centuries, they held that God was utterly impassible. We now see, of course, that is wrong.

If we have studied a great deal of Greek philosophy, we need to make sure that the God we worship is not one described in terms of Greek philosophy. The God we serve is, excuse the term, a Christian God. If you want to know what God is like, God is like Jesus Christ, his Son.

**Christianity's Influence On Education**

Christianity's influence on education has had a lasting impact on how people learn. The influence of Christian beliefs and principles has been constant throughout history, from the revered halls of venerable monasteries to the cutting-edge classrooms of humming colleges. We explore the contributions made by Christianity to education in this fascinating investigation.

Hold on to your academic hats because we will delve into the past and discover how the cross was so firmly rooted in the soil of knowledge. We will time-travel to a period in history where parchment and a quill controlled the world of scholars to start our voyage with a somber homage to the past.

In the modern era, Christianity continues to hold a prominent position in education. But what do those roles actually entail today? We will get right to the point and discover how Christian values coexist with secular ones in today's diverse education.

So, if you have ever wondered how beliefs influence our pursuit of knowledge or how faith plays a part in the classroom, stay with me. This trip into the complex world of Christian education will inevitably be enlightening, perhaps even irreverently. Let us find out what those classroom crosses are hiding!

Our story starts long ago when togas were fashionable, and philosophers walked the streets. Early Christians considered education to be a rare gem that was primarily kept in monastic settings. Monks served as the custodians of knowledge, meticulously copying old manuscripts, preserving ancient information, and occasionally imparting knowledge to a few eager beginners.

Fast forward to the Middle Ages, the Scholastic movement, which sounds sophisticated but means "let us get scholarly," swept over Europe. Consider it the medieval equivalent of a knowledge boom. Scholars like Thomas Aquinas combined Christian theology with Aristotle and Plato's ideas, resulting in a potent blend of faith and reason.


By the Renaissance, universities were blooming like mushrooms after a thunderstorm. These institutions were frequently fundamentally Christian, with religious doctrine at the heart of their curriculum. 

They, however, valued the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. It was like having the best of both worlds - faith and logic coexisting.

Then came the Enlightenment, a time when traditional traditions were challenged. However, Christianity in education did not fade away. Instead, it evolved. Many Christian faiths founded their schools in the 18th and 19th centuries to ensure that their principles were passed down.

As a result, Christianity in education has developed over time, from the sacred halls of monasteries to today's teeming campuses. This historical voyage, however, is more than simply dusty old books and robes; it is a tribute to the ongoing importance of faith in the pursuit of knowledge.


**Christianity's Influence On Law**

**Transition from Rule of Man to Rule of Law**

The transition from rule of man to rule of law is fairly well documented, though the Christian influence is too often neglected. The beginning of this transition has to be traced to the early Hebrew covenant with God, found in the Pentateuch, where “by rejecting the idea that law should treat the poor and the rich differently, Israelite law demonstrated a greater ethical awareness and a more humane spirit than other legal codes of the Near East”2 or, I would argue, anywhere else. This idea of impartial law remained largely a Jewish phenomenon until the advent of Christianity.

When Christianity first dawned, Greco-Roman societies regarded the individual as of little value except as part of the collective. Augusto Zimmerman explained, “Among the Romans, law protected social institutions such as the patriarchal family, but it did not safeguard the basic rights of the individual.”3 Legal codes of the day—and still today in more traditional societies—reflected this fact. Rule of law had little place in such a world. In time, this was to change and it did so in step with the steady expansion of Christianity’s influence.

For our purposes, it is sufficient to point to two oft-cited events that clearly evidence Christianity’s impact in this area. In the year 390, Ambrose, bishop of Milan, responded to Roman emperor Theodosius’ slaughter of some 7,000 people by rebuking him until he repented of the act.4 It’s important to remember that in the Roman world, an emperor could do virtually whatever he wanted. In this newly emerging social circumstance, however, the king was admonished and told to bow to some abstract higher authority, where previously there had been none! Theodosius realized that even he could not supersede the authority of God’s law. This represented a seismic shift in worldview from rule of man toward rule of law. From our current perspective, it is difficult to appreciate the magnitude of this change.

Moving forward in time to June of 1215, we find the barons of England convincing King John to sign the Magna Carta. This, too, was a pivotal moment in the sense that the king was allowing his subjects to fulfill their God-given rights while forfeiting his right to contravene. The king was no longer able to set himself above the law, which is “one of the oldest means of depriving individuals of liberty and justice.”5 Divine law now ruled and “the absolutist monarch inherited from Roman law was thereby counteracted and transformed into a monarch explicitly under law.”6


**Rule of Law Defined**

To clarify, rule of law exists where all people and institutions in a given society are held equally accountable before the law, and have equal protections under the law. In other words, whether one is king, president, priest, or plumber, one remains both accountable to and protected by the same laws in the same measure.

The societies where rule of law exists are the societies that hold a belief in a divine lawgiver standing over and above his creation as judge and jury. The reasons for this are fairly straightforward. Such universal, perfect, and immutable laws equally applicable to all for all time can only come from a divine lawgiver—one who is universally perceived to know what is absolutely right and wrong. Historically, rule of law is a radical idea and one that predominantly prevails where monotheistic Christianity shapes the consensus worldview.


**Transition from Rule of Man to Rule of Law**

The transition from rule of man to rule of law is fairly well documented, though the Christian influence is too often neglected. The beginning of this transition has to be traced to the early Hebrew covenant with God, found in the Pentateuch, where “by rejecting the idea that law should treat the poor and the rich differently, Israelite law demonstrated a greater ethical awareness and a more humane spirit than other legal codes of the Near East”2 or, I would argue, anywhere else.

Rule of law had little place in such a world. In time, this was to change and it did so in step with the steady expansion of Christianity’s influence.

For our purposes, it is sufficient to point to two oft-cited events that clearly evidence Christianity’s impact in this area.

This, too, was a pivotal moment in the sense that the king was allowing his subjects to fulfill their God-given rights while forfeiting his right to contravene. The king was no longer able to set himself above the law, which is “one of the oldest means of depriving individuals of liberty and justice.”5 Divine law now ruled and “the absolutist monarch inherited from Roman law was thereby counteracted and transformed into a monarch explicitly under law.”6

**Importance of Rule of Law**

What is it that makes this shift to rule of law so important? Why is it that we should appreciate this socio-cultural development in the here and now?

Consider, for example, a world without the rule of law where one’s fate, in the truest sense, lies in the hands of some higher human authority, be it a boss, mayor, sadistic relative, or hostile neighbor. What guides this authority’s decision-making other than his or her own self-interest? In that circumstance, the well-being of those under authority is at best a secondary consideration. Citizens and subordinates really have no protection and are constantly at risk of abuse for any reason or no reason at all.

In such a society, what rights would you have with respect to governing bodies? The answer is precisely none, other than the rights granted by those in power—rights subject to change without notice. Your freedom, as well as your life, would be at the mercy of their desires. Rule of man has prevailed virtually everywhere and in every generation, while rule of law has prevailed only in the Christian West. Even today we need not look far beyond our own borders to see the truth of this statement.

For us in twenty-first century America, it is difficult to imagine rule of man being preeminent, but in reality rule of man would probably prevail in our government, too, had our founding fathers not been profoundly influenced by Christianity. In other words, without Christianity’s social impact, there is no reason to believe we would be any closer to freedom and individual dignity than those carrying the yoke of Roman rule.

Our government and justice system is a privileged one based solely on our Judeo-Christian heritage. If we ignore our history, we do so at our own peril.

**Islam's Contributions To Science** 

Al-Jahiz (776-869) of Basra wrote the seven volumes of “Book of Animals”, which includes poetic descriptions and proverbs of over 350 varieties of animals. In this work, Al-Jahiz made observations describing evolution such as: 

“Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for resources, to avoid being eaten and to breed. Environmental factors influence organisms to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring.”

Al-Kindi (801-873) from Iraq oversaw the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language. He contributed greatly to making Greek thought accessible to Muslim audiences, carrying out this work from the “House of Wisdom”, an institute of translation and learning under the Abbasid Caliphate. He played an important role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic and Christian world, pioneered several methods of breaking ciphers, developed a scale to allow doctors to quantify the potency of medication, and contributed heavily to various subjects by writing 32 books on geometry, 22 books on medicine, 22 books on philosophy, 9 books on logic and 12 books on physics. His influence in these areas lasted for centuries. He is also well known for formulating the Kalam Cosmological Argument. 


Al-Battani (858-929) from Harran made astronomical observations at Antioch and Ar-Raqqah in Syria during the Caliphate of Harun Ar-Rashid. He composed works on astronomy with tables containing his observations of the sun and the moon, which were more accurate than Ptolemy’s “Almagest”. He catalogued 489 stars, refined the values for the length of a year to 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, 24 seconds. He obtained the value of the inclination of the ecliptic (of 23o 35’) and calculated 54.5” per year for the precession of the equinoxes. He used trigonometric methods for his calculations rather than geometric ones as often done in his time, an important advancement. He showed that the earth’s distance from the sun varies, which results in annular eclipses of the sun along with total eclipses. His work influenced scientists such as Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo and Copernicus.

Al-Biruni (973-1048) is one of the major figures of Islamic mathematics. He also contributed to astronomy, physics, medicine and history. Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the experimental scientific method to mechanics, unified statics and dynamics into the science of mechanics, and combined the fields of hydrostatics with dynamics to create hydrodynamics. 

Bīrūnī also devised his own method of determining the radius of the earth by observing the height of a mountain and carried it out at Nandana in Pind Dadan Khan, India (present-day Pakistan). In addition, due to an apparatus he constructed himself, he succeeded in determining remarkably precise specific gravities for a variety of metals and minerals.

Ibn al- Haytham (965-1040) from Basra was a Muslim polymath and philosopher who made significant contributions to the principles of optics, astronomy, mathematics, meteorology, visual perception and the scientific method. He was honoured as Europe’s “Ptolemy the Second”, and is especially known for his contributions to Optics due to his book entitled “Book of Optics”. He emphasized greatly on the importance of skepticism and relied on systemic experimentation and controlled testing in scientific inquiries and experiment. He famously said, 

“The seeker after truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them… but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration and not the sayings of human beings whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. he should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.” 

Avicenna (980-1037), a polymath known as one of the greatest minds of his time, contributed to many fields (including philosophy, poetry and medicine). He helped define an era of enlightenment in the Islamic world during the middle ages, coined the Islamic Golden Age (thought to be from 786 to 1258CE). It is in the field of medicine where Avicenna’s greatest work is found. The canon of medicine (al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb) is an encyclopedia of medicine consisting of five books. The cannon encompasses almost all aspects of medicine, such as causes and descriptions of diseases associated with every organ, advanced anatomy of the human body, and even rules for experimenting with new drugs, a subject on which Avicenna describes the inadequacy of animal testing versus human trials. Avicenna’s canon of medicine was the medical standard across the Islamic world and medieval Europe up until the 16th century, with Sir William Osler, one of the founding professors of John Hopkins Hospital stating it to be ‘the most famous medical textbook ever written.’

The book of healing (Kitab Al-Shifaʾ) is Avicenna’s great work. Combining science and philosophy, this book is an an encyclopedia introducing psychological reasons for illnesses such as mood disorders, and for the first time divided human perception into the five external senses. (i.e., held them responsible for human perception).

Ibn Rushd (1126-1198) of Spain had a great impact on Christian Europe and has been described as the “founding father of secular thought in Western Europe”. He wrote commentaries on Aristotle’s works, which became the foundation for the Aristotelian revival in the 12th and 13th centuries.

He wrote over 20,000 pages in science, theology and philosophy. One of his most important works was “The Incoherence of the Incoherence”, a rebuttal of a work by Hazrat Imam Ghazali (rh) in which he claimed that philosophy and revelation do not contradict each other and that these are different means of reaching the same truth.He contributed to medicine in his book “Colliget”, he made a compilation of the works of Galen and wrote a commentary on the “Canon of Medicine” by Avicenna. He contributed three books in the area of physics and developed the notion that bodies have an inherent resistance to motion – an idea adopted later by Thomas Aquinas and then by Johannes Kepler who referred to this as “inertia.”

**Islam's Contribution To Mathematics**

Islamic's contributions to mathematics began around ad 825, when the Baghdad mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī wrote his famous treatise al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wa’l-muqābala (translated into Latin in the 12th century as Algebra et Almucabal, from which the modern term algebra is derived). By the end of the 9th century a significant Greek mathematical corpus, including works of Euclid, Archimedes (c. 285–212/211 bc), Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–190 bc), Ptolemy (fl. ad 127–145), and Diophantus, had been translated into Arabic. Similarly, ancient Babylonian and Indian mathematics, as well as more recent contributions by Jewish sages, were available to Islamic scholars. This unique background allowed the creation of a whole new kind of mathematics that was much more than a mere amalgamation of these earlier traditions. A systematic study of methods for solving quadratic equations constituted a central concern of Islamic mathematicians. A no less central contribution was related to the Islamic reception and transmission of ideas related to the Indian system of numeration, to which they added decimal fractions (fractions such as 0.125, or 1/8).

Al-Khwārizmī’s algebraic work embodied much of what was central to Islamic contributions. He declared that his book was intended to be of “practical” value, yet this definition hardly applies to its contents. In the first part of his book, al-Khwārizmī presented the procedures for solving six types of equations: squares equal roots, squares equal numbers, roots equal numbers, squares and roots equal numbers, squares and numbers equal roots, and roots and numbers equal squares. In modern notation, these equations would be stated ax2 = bx, ax2 = c, bx = c, ax2 + bx = c, ax2 + c = bx, and bx + c = ax2, respectively. Only positive numbers were considered legitimate coefficients or solutions to equations. Moreover, neither symbolic representation nor abstract symbol manipulation appeared in these problems—even the quantities were written in words rather than in symbols. In fact, all procedures were described verbally. 

In the second part of his book, al-Khwārizmī used propositions taken from Book II of Euclid’s Elements in order to provide geometric justifications for his procedures. As remarked above, in their original context these were purely geometric propositions. Al-Khwārizmī directly connected them for the first time, however, to the solution of quadratic equations. His method was a hallmark of the Islamic approach to solving equations—systematize all cases and then provide a geometric justification, based on Greek sources. Typical of this approach was the Persian mathematician and poet Omar Khayyam’s Risālah fiʾl-barāhīn ʿalā masāʾil al-jabr waʾl-muqābalah (c. 1070; “Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra”), in which Greek knowledge concerning conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas) was applied to questions involving cubic equations.

The use of Greek-style geometric arguments in this context also led to a gradual loosening of certain traditional Greek constraints. In particular, Islamic mathematics allowed, and indeed encouraged, the unrestricted combination of commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes within the same framework, as well as the simultaneous manipulation of magnitudes of different dimensions as part of the solution of a problem. For example, the Egyptian mathematician Abu Kāmil (c. 850–930) treated the solution of a quadratic equation as a number rather than as a line segment or an area. Combined with the decimal system, this approach was fundamental in developing a more abstract and general conception of number, which was essential for the eventual creation of a full-fledged abstract idea of an equation.

**Islam's Contribution To Art**

Islamic arts, literary, performing, and visual arts of the vast populations of the Islamic world from the 7th century onward. Adherents of Islam and those living in Islamic settings have created such an immense variety of literatures, performing arts, visual arts, and music that it virtually defies any comprehensive definition. In the narrowest sense, the arts of the Islamic peoples might be said to include only those arising directly from the practice of Islam. More commonly, however, the term is extended to include all of the arts produced by Muslim peoples, whether connected with their religion or not. In this article, the subject includes the arts created in pre-Islamic times by Arabs and other peoples in Asia Minor and North Africa who eventually adopted the Islamic faith. On the other hand, arts produced in cultural areas that were only partially Muslim are discussed primarily in articles on arts of those regions (see Central Asian arts; South Asian arts; Southeast Asian arts).

Like most prophetic religions, Islam is not conducive to fine arts. Representation of living beings is prohibited—not in the Qurʾān but in the prophetic tradition. Thus, the centre of the Islamic artistic tradition lies in calligraphy, a distinguishing feature of this culture, in which the word as the medium of divine revelation plays such an important role. Representational art was found, however, in some early palaces and “at the doors of the bathhouses,” according to later Persian poetry. After the 13th century a highly refined art of miniature developed, primarily in the non-Arab countries; it dwells, however, only rarely upon religious subjects. The typical expression of Muslim art is the arabesque, both in its geometric and in its organic form—one leaf, one flower growing out of the other, without beginning and end and capable of almost innumerable variations, only gradually detected by the eye, which never lose their charm. An aversion to empty spaces distinguishes that art; neither the tile-covered walls of a mosque nor the rich imagery of a poem allows an unembellished area, and the decoration of a carpet can be extended almost without limit.

The centre of Islamic religion is the clean place for prayer, enlarged into the mosque, which comprises the community and all its needs. The essential structure is similar throughout the Muslim world. There are, of course, period and regional differences—large, wide court mosques of early times; the court mosques with big halls of Iran and adjacent countries; central buildings with the wonderfully shaped domes of the Ottoman Empire. The implements, however, are the same: a niche called a mihrab—pointing to Mecca—made of wood, marble, mosaic, stone, tiles; a small pulpit (minbar) for the Friday sermon; minarets, locally differently shaped but always rising like the call to prayer that is uttered from their tops; the wooden carved stands for the Qurʾān, which is to be written in the most perfect form; sometimes highly artistic lamps (made in Syria and proverbially mentioned throughout the Muslim world); perhaps bronze candlesticks, with inlaid ornaments; and rich variations of the prayer mats. If any decoration was needed, it was the words of God, beautifully written or carved in the walls or around the domes. At first connected with the mosques and later independent of them are schools, mausoleums, rooms for the students, and cells for the religious masters.

The poetry of the Arabs consisted in the beginning of praise and satirical poems thought to be full of magical qualities. The strict rules of the outward form of the poems (monorhyme, complicated metre) even in pre-Islamic times led to a certain formalism and encouraged imitation. Another early poetic form was the elegy, as noted in the work of the Arab female poet al-Khansāʾ (died after 630).

For the most part, however, Goethe’s statement that the stories of The Thousand and One Nights have no goal in themselves shows his understanding of the character of Arabic belles lettres, contrasting them with the Islamic religion, which aims at “collecting and uniting people in order to achieve one high goal.” Poets, on the other hand, rove around without any ethical purpose, according to the Qurʾān. For many pious Muslims, poetry was something suspect, opposed to the divine law, especially since it sang mostly of forbidden wine and of free love. The combination of music and poetry, as practiced in court circles and among the mystics, has always aroused the wrath of the lawyer divines who wield so much authority in Islamic communities. This opposition may partly explain why Islamic poetry and fine arts took refuge in a kind of unreal world, using fixed images that could be correctly interpreted only by those who were knowledgeable in the art.The ambiguity of Persian poetry, which oscillates between the worldly, the divine, and often the political level, is typical of Islamic writings. Especially in Iran and the countries under its cultural influence, this kind of poetry formed the most important part of literature. Epic poetry of all kinds developed exclusively outside the Arabic-speaking countries; Western readers look in vain for an epical structure in such long poems (as in the case of the prose-romances of the Arabs) and find instead a rather aimless representation of facts and fictions. A similar characteristic even conditions innumerable historical works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, which, especially in classical times, contain much valuable information, put together without being shaped into a real work of art; only rarely does the historian or philosopher reach a comprehensive view. The first attempt at a philosophy of history, Ibn Khaldūn’s Muqaddimah, in the 14th century, was rarely studied by his Arab compatriots.

The accumulation of large amounts of material, which is carefully organized up to the present, seems typical of all branches of Islamic scholarship, from theology to natural sciences. There are many minute observations and descriptions but rarely a full view of the whole process. Later, especially in the Persian, Turkish, and Indo-Muslim areas, a tendency to overstress the decorative elements of prose is evident, and the contents even of official chronicles are hidden behind a network of rhymed prose, which is often difficult to disentangle.

 **Islam's Contribution To Architecture**

**The Advent of Islamic Architecture**

The 7th century CE marked a turning point in the Islamic architecture history of the Arabian Peninsula, with the emergence of a religion that would come to shape the region’s artistic and cultural traditions. Born in the bustling city of Mecca (Makkah), Islam was founded by a merchant named Muhammad. As Muhammad's teachings began to spread throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Southern Europe, the impact of this new religion was profound. Islamic culture began to flourish, with centres of learning emerging across the region, devoted to subjects ranging from philosophy and astronomy to medicine and the arts. But it was in the realm of architecture that the influence of Islam was perhaps most keenly felt.

Islamic architecture comprises the architectural styles of buildings associated with Islam. It encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of Islam to the present day. The Islamic world encompasses a wide geographic area historically ranging from western Africa and Europe to eastern Asia. Certain commonalities are shared by Islamic architectural styles across all these regions, but over time different regions developed their own styles according to local materials and techniques, local dynasties and patrons, different regional centers of artistic production, and sometimes different religious affiliations.[1][2]

Early Islamic architecture was influenced by Roman, Byzantine, Iranian, and Mesopotamian architecture and all other lands which the early Muslim conquests conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries.[3][4][5][6][7] Later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings and in the decoration of surfaces with Islamic calligraphy, arabesques, and geometric motifs.[8] New architectural elements like minarets, muqarnas, and multifoil arches were invented. Common or important types of buildings in Islamic architecture include mosques, madrasas, tombs, palaces, hammams (public baths), Sufi hospices (e.g. khanqahs or zawiyas), fountains and sabils, commercial buildings (e.g. caravanserais and bazaars), and military fortifications.[2]

**Islam's Contribution To Legal Systems**

This chapter turns to a very different legal tradition, that of Islamic law. Stemming from a religious origin and encompassing not only traditional legal rules but also rules concerning the living of a moral life, the Shari'a provides a different legal culture and set of legal institutions than are found in the common and civil law traditions. To highlight the unique characteristics of the Islamic legal tradition, this chapter considers the development of the legal traditions of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. While both states are within the Islamic legal tradition, Egypt and Saudi Arabia belong to different schools of Islamic jurisprudence, which results in different legal culture and institutions, and differing policies toward international law. This chapter emphasizes the important role that cultural factors such as ties to religion can play in influencing the policies states adopt towards international law, and also considers the realities of contemporary politics.

Many people in the West tend to think of a progressive and rational West in stark contrast to a backward and stagnant Muslim world. In addition, the West is frequently assumed to have developed autonomously as a result of its own unique features. Yet, the relationship between the West and the Muslim world is far more complex than at first appears. Their histories have been marked by numerous exchanges. Those in the areas of architecture, science, philosophy and trade are being increasingly studied in the West,1 although they remain little known among the general public. Less well-documented and even less well-known outside specific academic circles is the possible influence of Islamic legal institutions on those of the West. However, if some important European legal institutions that emerged in the early Middle Ages have at least some Islamic origins, this area of transmission and reception has potentially important implications for understanding the emergence of the modern state and governance in Europe. Indeed, it would cast another light on the establishment of a rule of law and the development of an impersonal state, which, in turn, contributed to the breakdown of feudal relations and, later, to the emergence of capitalism in Europe.

**Rituals and Practices:**

**Christianity:** In Christian belief and practice, a sacrament is a rite, instituted by Christ that mediates grace, constituting a sacred mystery. The term is derived from the Latin word sacramentum , which was used to translate the Greek word for “mystery.” Views concerning both “what rites are sacramental,” and “what it means for an act to be a sacrament” vary among Christian denominations and traditions.

**Eschaton**

The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking is Christian eschatology — the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible.

The major issues in Christian eschatology are the Tribulation, death and the afterlife, the Rapture, the Second Coming of Jesus, Resurrection of the Dead, Heaven and Hell, Millennialism, the Last Judgment, the end of the world, and the New Heavens and New Earth.

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the end of time after a period of severe persecution (theGreat Tribulation ). All who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the Kingdom of God in fulfillment of scriptural prophecies.

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are Baptism and the Eucharist (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: Confirmation(Chrismation in the Orthodox tradition), Holy Orders, Confession, Anointing of the Sick , and Matrimony . Taken together, these are the Seven Sacraments , as recognized by churches in the High Church tradition—notably Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Independent Catholic, Old Catholic, most Anglicans, and some Lutherans. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology. Most Protestant Christian denominations that believe these rites do not communicate grace prefer to call them ordinances.

**Rituals and Rites**

Liturgical Calendar

Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around a liturgical calendar. This includes holy days, such as solemnities , which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus or the saints, periods of fasting such as Lent , and other pious events, such as memoria or lesser festivals commemorating saints.

Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost. A few churches make no use of a liturgical calendar.

**Baptism**

This is a mosaic of the Baptism of Christ in Jordan. In the center is Christ our Saviour in the river Jordan. On a rock stands John the Baptist, in his left hand is a bent rod, and his right hand holds a patera, shell; from which he pours water on the head of the Redeemer; over whom descends the dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost, with expanded wings, and emitting rays of glory and grace.

Baptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the Church. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations.

Firstly, differences occur on whether the act has any spiritual significance . Some churches hold to the doctrine ofBaptismal Regeneration , which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person’s faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. This view is held by Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, while others simply acknowledge it as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person.

Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act . These methods being: Baptism by Immersion; if immersion is total, Baptism by Submersion; and Baptism by Affusion (pouring), and Baptism by Aspersion (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of Infant Baptism.

**Prayer**

Jesus’ teaching on prayer in the Sermon on the Mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as ‘pagan,’ and instead a simple trust in God’s fatherly goodness is encouraged [Mat. 6:5–15]. Elsewhere in the New Testament this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized [Phil. 4:6] and [Jam. 5:13–19]. This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures, such as genuflection or making the sign of the cross. Kneeling, bowing and prostrations are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony. At other times the older orant posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

**Intercessory Prayer**

Intercessory prayer is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the Apostle Peter on behalf of sick persons [Acts 9:40] and by prophets of the Old Testament in favor of other people [1Ki 17:19–22]. In the New Testament book of James no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet Elijah [Jam 5:16–18]. The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.

The ancient church, in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, developed a tradition of asking for the intercession of (deceased) saints, and this remains the practice of most Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Anglican churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation however rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ. The reformer, Huldrych Zwingli, admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was idolatrous. (43)


**Islam:** The Five Pillars (Shahada, Salat, Zakat, Sawm, Hajj), Friday prayers, observance of Ramadan and Eid festivals.
The five pillars – the declaration of faith (shahada), prayer (salah), alms-giving (zakat), fasting (sawm) and pilgrimage (hajj) – constitute the basic norms of Islamic practice. They are accepted by Muslims globally irrespective of ethnic, regional or sectarian differences.

Upholding the pillars is considered obligatory for all sincere followers of the Prophet Muhammad, male and female, Sunni and Shi‘a, but that doesn’t mean that all those who identify as Muslims keep them consistently. As in all religions, circumstances vary and some people are more committed than others. Such things as age, stage of life, work, family responsibilities, health and wealth all make a difference.

**The pillars**
The Shahada is the fundamental statement of faith and commitment made by Muslims: “There is no God but God (Allah), and Muhammad is His Messenger.” It distinguishes Muslims from those of other faiths. The Shahada is perhaps better known in the West as the Arabic phrase on the flags of ISIS, al-Shabaab and Boko Haram. However, the Shahada is by no means the preserve of violent groups, in fact reciting it three times in front of witnesses is a requirement of becoming a Muslim.

**Salah** is the ritual prayer of Islam through which all Muslims conform to the will of Allah. Prayer is performed in the direction of Mecca five times a day. Friday is set aside as the day for congregational prayer (Jum’a). The ready knowledge that large numbers of Muslims will be gathered together for communal prayer has frequently been exploited by terrorist networks such as Islamic State. In 2015 and 2016, Shi‘a mosques were bombed in Kuwait, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Boko Haram has also attacked mosques in northern Nigeria. Places of worship full of people at prayer represent easy symbolic targets for suicide bombers, where maximum damage and loss of life can be achieved.

The term **zakat** refers to the obligatory donation of a portion of a Muslim’s surplus wealth. Islamic charities encourage donors to use their services to relieve suffering and to help refugees, victims of environmental disasters, the urban poor and those in conflict zones and in recent years relief has been provided in Gaza, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Whilst the majority of charities operate within the law, some have been banned following allegations that they have used their resources to fund terrorist activities.

**Sawm** – Muslims are expected to fast during Ramadan – the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. During daylight hours (which vary depending on the time of year in which Ramadan falls), they abstain from food and drink, sexual activity and smoking, breaking the fast with a meal after sunset. Those who are elderly, ill, pregnant or breast-feeding are exempt, and children are not required to participate.

Completing the **Hajj**, the pilgrimage to Mecca, is a duty that every Muslim should perform during their lifetime. All pilgrims should be in good physical and spiritual health before they make the journey. Whilst in Mecca, they complete a series of individual and collective actions on the various days of their visit, following a pattern set by Muhammad.

Some two million Muslims from around the world went on Hajj in 2015. The 25,000 pilgrims who travelled from the UK joined thousands of Muslims from many other countries, all performing the same rituals irrespective of their many differences.

Knowing something about the five pillars and their significance for Muslims isn’t just important to correct misunderstandings about what Muslims believe, it is also important in the work environment and for good working relations. For example, Muslim colleagues may request breaks and a space for prayer as well as support whilst fasting during Ramadan or annual leave at the time of the Hajj. These are important issues for all Muslims, and not markers of fundamentalism. Understanding this better can help overcome prejudices about Muslims.

**B. Buddhism and Hinduism**

**Similarities Between Buddhism and Hinduism**

Buddhism and Hinduism share numerous terms and concepts such as: dharma, karma, samadhi, samsara, dhyana, jñana, klesha, nirodha, samskāra, brahmin, brahmacarya, and nirvana.[43]

The Buddha used numerous religious terms which are also used in Hinduism, though he often used them in different and novel ways. Many terms which Buddhism shares with Hinduism carry a different meaning in the Buddhist tradition. For example, in the Samaññaphala Sutta, the Buddha is depicted presenting a notion of the "three knowledges" (tevijja) – a term also used in the Vedic tradition to describe knowledge of the Vedas – as being not texts, but things that he had experienced.[44] The true "three knowledges" are said to be constituted by the process of achieving enlightenment, which is what the Buddha is said to have achieved in the three watches of the night of his enlightenment.[45]

**Karma, rebirth, and samsara**

Karma is a central part of Hindu and Buddhist teachings. Karma is a word meaning action or activity and often implies its subsequent results (also called karma-phala, "the fruits of action"). Karma theory is commonly applied to the ethical realm of cause and effect in both Buddhism and Hinduism. In Buddhism and in Hinduism, a person's words, thoughts and actions form the basis for good and bad karma. Good deeds (good karmas) lead to good karmic results (Sanskrit: karma-phala, the fruits of karma) which can include the circumstances of one's future reincarnation. Likewise, evil actions might result in negative karmic consequences.[46][47]

Thus, the Indian idea of karma is also closely associated with the idea of reincarnation or rebirth.[48] One's karmas in previous lives affect one's present existence, and one's actions in this life will lead to effects in the next life. Both Buddhism and Hinduism accept that living beings are constantly cycling through different bodies and realms of existence, in a repetitive process called saṃsāra (literally "the wandering").[49][50]

**Dharma**

Dharma (Sanskrit, Devanagari: धर्म or Pāli Dhamma) is an Indic term common to all Indian religions. Dharma can mean nature, natural law, reality, teaching, religion or duty, and with respect to its significance for spirituality and religion might be considered the way of the higher truths. A Hindu appellation for Hinduism itself is Sanātana Dharma, which translates as "the eternal dharma". Similarly, Buddha Dharma is a common way that Buddhists refer to Buddhism.

In Hinduism, Dharma can refer generally to religious duty or universal order (similar to rta), and also mean social order, right conduct, or simply virtue. In Buddhism, Dharma can mean the true nature of things or the natural law that the Buddha discovered. It can also refer to the teachings of the Buddha, which explain and reveal this nature.

**Asceticism and monasticism**

Both Buddhism and some forms of Hinduism emphasize the importance of monasticism. In Buddhism, the monastic sangha plays a central role in teaching and passing down the Buddha's Dharma. Monasticism is also seen as an ideal way of life for cultivating the qualities that lead to awakening. In certain sects of Hinduism, the life of the renouncer (sannyasa) is also very important.

**Cosmology and deities**

Buddhist cosmology and Hindu cosmology share many similarities. Both cosmologies are cyclical and both accept that the universe goes through constant cycles of growth and destruction. Both traditions also accept that there are many different realms or worlds (lokas) other than the human realm.[51][52] These include various hell realms and celestial deva realms.

Buddhism and Hinduism share some of the same deities, including:

Saraswati (known as Benzaiten in Japan),
Vishnu (known as Upulvan in Sri Lanka),
Shiva (known as Maheśvara in Buddhism)
Mahākāla (a form of Shiva in Hinduism) is seen as a form of Avalokiteśvara in Mahayana Buddhism
Indra, Vedic-era Hindu storm god of the Heavens, who is also widely depicted in Buddhist scriptures, see: Śakra
Ganesh (more widely known as Ganapati in Buddhism)
Brahma, a key deity in the old Upanishads who is also seen as a protective figure in Buddhism (called Mahabrahma) and also as a class of deities, see: Brahma in Buddhism.[53][54][55]
Lakshmi (in Japanese Buddhism she is known as Kishijoten)
Tara is an important Buddhist deity in Tibetan Buddhism. In Hinduism, Tara Devi is one of the ten Mahavidyas.
The Buddhist text Mahamayuri Tantra, written during the 1–3rd centuries CE, mentions various deities (such as Maheshvara) throughout South Asia, and invokes them for the protection of the Buddhadharma. It also mentions a large number of Vedic rishis.[56]

**Liberation**

Both Buddhism and Hinduism teach a similar goal of liberation or spiritual enlightenment from the cycle of rebirths (samsara). Both religions accept that the escape from the cycle of rebirths or samsara is the highest goal of the spiritual life. In both religions, this liberation is considered the complete end of rebirth or reincarnation. In Hinduism, this liberation may be called moksha, nirvana, or kaivalya; and in Buddhism it may be called vimoksha (Pali: vimokha), nirvana (Pali: nibbana) or bodhi (awakening).[57][58] Both Hinduism and Buddhism use the term Nirvana (or Nibbana in Pali language) for spiritual liberation, which literally means 'blowing out' or 'quenching'. The term is pre-Buddhist, but its etymology is not essentially conclusive for finding out its exact meaning as the highest goal of early Buddhism.[59][60]

Both religions also venerate the liberated beings who have attain the goal of spiritual liberation. Buddhism calls liberated beings either arhats or Buddhas (awakened ones). In Hinduism, liberated beings are commonly called jivanmuktas, though the term nirvana is also used. The term "Buddha" is also used in some Hindu scriptures. In the Vayu Purana for example, the sage Daksha calls Shiva a Buddha.[61]

**What Are the Differences between Christianity and Islam?**

Hinduism is about understanding Brahma, existence, from within the Atman, which roughly means "self" or "soul," whereas Buddhism is about becoming awakened (Buddhi) by recognising, experiencing and validating the four noble truths. In Hinduism, attaining the highest life is a process of removing the bodily distractions from life, allowing one to eventually understand the Brahma nature within. In Buddhism, one follows a disciplined life, meditates, and discards wrong views. In so doing, one either realises peace (Nirvana) or instead becomes a Buddha and continues to liberate all beings from suffering.

Hinduism is Vedic, and Buddhism is non-Vedic. Hinduism is Brahmanical, and Buddhism is non-Brahmanical.

Buddhism, like Jainism and many other Indian traditions are Śramaṇic traditions which originally referred to several non-Brahmanical ascetic religions parallel to but separate from the Vedic religions of India such as Hinduism. The Śramaṇa tradition includes primarily Jainism, Buddhism, and others such as the Ājīvika.

It is a mistake to consider that Hinduism or Buddhism are the progenitor of the other. Buddhism stems from the non-Vedic Śramaṇa, whereas Hinduism remains Vedic but also strongly influenced by the Śramaṇa many traditions.

**Beliefs and Doctrines:**

**Hinduism:** Hinduism is one of the world's oldest religions and is the oldest religion that is still practiced today. The religious tradition of Hinduism is primarily focused on connecting to the supreme god or ultimate reality, known as Brahman, and bettering oneself to escape the cycle of reincarnation. The tradition functions not only as a religion, but the definition of Hinduism also includes combining the beliefs, cultural practices, and philosophy of ancient and modern India. Hinduism is famous for having thousands of deities, both gods and goddesses, but most Hindus believe that all of the deities are manifestations of Brahman. In the 21st century, Hinduism is considered the third most-practiced religion in the world, following Christianity and Islam. It is especially common in India, the area where it originated, as 94% of the world's Hindu population resides there. It is also widely practiced in Nepal and Bangladesh.

**Polytheism**

The word "polytheism" stems from the Greek words "polys" and "theos," which mean "multiple" and "god" respectively.

How did polytheism come to exist, one might ask? Well, examine the people of ancient societies and imagine how they sought to understand the natural world. What makes the rain come down from the clouds? How does the village ensure that there is enough food for the winter months? What are the bright dots in the sky at night? People naturally seek to understand their environment and come up with reasons as to why and how events occur. Lacking modern scientific understanding of cause and effect, people attributed natural phenomena to supreme beings known as deities or gods/goddesses. Given that there have been polytheistic societies from all over the world, dating thousands of years old, the development of religion can be presumed a natural human characteristic. The desire to understand the world is strong! Herein exists a plethora of examples from around the world, both past and present, which provide a glimpse into what it means to be polytheistic.

**Concepts of Karma**

Karma, in Indian religion and philosophy, the universal causal law by which good or bad actions determine the future modes of an individual’s existence. Karma represents the ethical dimension of the process of rebirth (samsara), belief in which is generally shared among the religious traditions of India. Indian soteriologies (theories of salvation) posit that future births and life situations will be conditioned by actions performed during one’s present life—which itself has been conditioned by the accumulated effects of actions performed in previous lives. The doctrine of karma thus directs adherents of Indian religions toward their common goal: release (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. Karma thus serves two main functions within Indian moral philosophy: it provides the major motivation to live a moral life, and it serves as the primary explanation of the existence of evil.

Derived from the Sanskrit word karman, meaning “act,” the term karma carried no ethical significance in its earliest specialized usage. In ancient texts (1000–700 bce) of the Vedic religion, karma referred simply to ritual and sacrificial action. As the priestly theology of sacrifice was articulated by Brahman priests over the following centuries, however, ritual action came to be regarded as effective by itself, independent of the gods. Karma as ritual functioned autonomously and according to a cosmic ritual law.

The doctrine of karma implies that one person’s karma cannot have an effect on another person’s future. Yet, while karma is in theory specific to each individual, many aspects of Indian religions reflect the widely held belief that karma may be shared. For example, the doctrine of the transfer of merit, whereby one person can transfer his good karma to another, is found in both Buddhism and Hinduism. Ancestral offerings and other rituals for the departed show that acts done by the living are believed to influence the well-being of the dead. Finally, pious activities, including pilgrimages, are often performed for the benefit of living or deceased relatives.

**Dharma**

The concept of dharma was in use in the historical Vedic religion (1500–500 BCE), and its meaning and conceptual scope has evolved over several millennia. In Hinduism, dharma denotes behaviours that are considered to be in accord with Ṛta—the "order and custom" that makes life and universe possible.[note 1] This includes duties, rights, laws, conduct, virtues and "right way of living". Dharma is believed to have a transtemporal validity, and is one of the Puruṣārtha.

In Buddhism, dharma (Pali: dhamma) refers to the teachings of the Buddha. In Buddhist philosophy, dhamma/dharma is also the term for "phenomena".[note 2] Dharma in Jainism refers to the teachings of Tirthankara (Jina) and the body of doctrine pertaining to the purification and moral transformation of humans. In Sikhism, dharma indicates the path of righteousness, proper religious practices, and performing one's own moral duties.

As with the other components of the Puruṣārtha, the concept of dharma is pan-Indian. The ancient Tamil text Tirukkuṟaḷ, despite being a collection of aphoristic teachings on dharma (aram), artha (porul), and kama (inpam), is completely and exclusively based on aṟam—the Tamil term for dharma.

**Moksha and Samsara**

To understand moksha, which means 'liberation,' one must first understand several other important ideas in Hinduism - particularly, samsara. Samsara is a Sanskrit word that refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, to the passing of the soul from one life to another. As the soul transitions between these lives, the next incarnation is informed by the deeds of the previous life. This is the Hindu belief of the concept of karma. You may have heard people talk about karma and the idea that people's choices will come back to affect them one way or another in the future. The Hindu concept of karma is similar to the popular use, but a person's responsibility for her/his actions, good or bad, is dealt with in the next life, not the current one.

The end of the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) is the ultimate point of existence in Hinduism. There are four goals, collectively called purusartha, aimed at achieving samsara, with the fourth of these being the ultimate goal of obtaining moksha. As people move through the first three goals (dharma, artha, and kama), they release attachments to worldly possessions and desires, leading to the goal of achieving moksha. Sound familiar? The Hindu concept of moksha is similar to the Buddhist concept of nirvana.

A visual representation of the concept of moksha can be seen in this Hindu painting which shows the elephant Gajendra experiencing moksha. Instead of focusing on the suffering from the crocodile biting his leg, he focuses on Vishnu, who liberates him.

**Caste System**

The origin of the caste system is not known with certainty. Hindus maintain that the proliferation of the castes (jatis, literally “births”) was the result of intermarriage (which is prohibited in Hindu works on dharma), which led to the subdivision of the four classes, or varnas. Modern theorists, however, assume that castes arose from differences in family ritual practices, racial distinctions, and occupational differentiation and specialization. Scholars also doubt whether the simple varna system was ever more than a theoretical socioreligious ideal and have emphasized that the highly complex division of Hindu society into nearly 3,000 castes and subcastes was probably in place even in ancient times.

In general, a caste is an endogamous hereditary group of families bearing a common name, often claiming a common descent, as a rule professing to follow the same hereditary calling, adhering to the same customs—especially regarding purity, meals, and marriages—and often further divided into smaller endogamous circles. Moreover, tribes, guilds, or religious communities characterized by particular customs—for example, the Lingayats—could easily be regarded as castes. The status of castes varies in different localities. Although social mobility is possible, the mutual relationship of castes is hierarchically determined: local Brahman groups occupy the highest place, and differences in ritual purity are the main criteria of position in the hierarchy. Most impure are the so-called “untouchables,” officially designated as Scheduled Castes in the constitution of modern India. Many Scheduled Caste groups now prefer the name Dalit (“Crushed” or “Oppressed”). Among the Scheduled Castes, however, there are numerous subdivisions, each of which regards itself as superior to others.

Traditional Hindus maintain that the ritual impurity and “untouchability” inherent in these groups does not essentially differ from that temporarily associated with mourners or menstruating women. This, and the fact that some exterior group or other might rise in estimation and become an interior one or that individual outcastes might be well-to-do, does not alter the fact that there was social discrimination. The Scheduled Castes were subjected to various socioreligious disabilities before mitigating tendencies helped bring about reform. After independence, social discrimination was prohibited, and the practice of preventing access to religious, occupational, or civil rights on the grounds of untouchability was made a punishable offense. Despite these prohibitions, Scheduled Castes were sometimes barred from the use of temples and other religious institutions and from public schools.

From the traditional Hindu point of view, this social system is the necessary complement of the principles of dharma, karma, and samsara. Corresponding to hells and heavenly regions in the hereafter, the castes are the mundane social frame within which karma is manifested and worked out. 
   
**Vedas and Upanishads**
    
 With the last component of the Vedas, the philosophically oriented and esoteric texts known as the Upanishads (traditionally “sitting near a teacher” but originally understood as “connection” or “equivalence”), Vedic ritualism and the doctrine of the interconnectedness of separate phenomena were superseded by a new emphasis on knowledge alone—primarily knowledge of the ultimate identity of all phenomena, which merely appeared to be separate. The beginnings of philosophy and mysticism in Indian religious history occurred during the period of the compilation of the Upanishads, roughly between 700 and 500 bce. Historically, the most important of the Upanishads are the two oldest, the Brihadaranyaka (“Great Forest Text”; c. 10th–5th century bce) and the Chandogya (pertaining to the Chandogas, priests who intone hymns at sacrifices), both of which are compilations that record the traditions of sages (rishis) of the period—notably Yajnavalkya, who was a pioneer of new religious ideas.   
    
 The Upanishads reveal the desire to obtain the mystical knowledge that ensures freedom from “re-death” (punarmrityu), or birth and death in a new existence. Throughout the later Vedic period, the idea that the world of heaven is not the end of existence—and that even in heaven death is inevitable—became increasingly common. Vedic thinkers became concerned about the impermanence of religious merit and its loss in the hereafter, as well as about the transience of any form of existence after death—an existence that would culminate in re-death. The means of escaping and conquering death devised in the Brahmanas were of a ritual nature, but one of the oldest Upanishads, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, emphasizes the knowledge of the cosmic connection underlying ritual. When the doctrine of the identity of atman (the self) and brahman (the Absolute) was established in the Upanishads, those sages who were inclined to meditative thought substituted the true knowledge of the self and the realization of this identity for the ritual method.

This theme of the quest for a supreme unifying truth, for the reality underlying existence, is exemplified in the question posed by the seeker in the Mundaka Upanishad: “What is it that, by being known, all else becomes known?” What is sought is an experiential knowledge that is different from the “lower” knowledge that can be conceptualized and articulated by human beings. Thus, the supreme truth is understood as ineffable. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that brahman is this ineffable truth; brahman is also truth (satya), knowledge (jnana), infinity (ananta), consciousness (chit), and bliss (ananda). Other Upanishads describe brahman as the hidden, inner controller of the human soul. The experiential knowledge of the relationship between the human soul (atman) and the supreme being (brahman) is said to bring an end to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. To know brahman is to know all; in knowing brahman, one achieves a transcendental consciousness that comprehends, in some measure, the unity of the universe and the deep connection between the soul and brahman.

In subsequent centuries the main theories concerned with the divine essence underlying the world were harmonized and synthetically combined. The tendency of these theories was to extol one god as the supreme lord and originator (Ishvara)—at once Purusha and Prajapati and brahman and the self of all beings. For those who worshipped him, he was the goal of identificatory meditation, which leads to complete cessation of phenomenal existence and becomes the refuge of those who seek eternal peace. The Advaita Vedanta philosopher and theologian Shankara (8th century ce) exercised enormous influence on subsequent Hindu thinking through his elegant synthesis of the nontheistic and theistic aspects of Upanishadic teaching. In his commentaries on several of the Upanishads, he distinguished between nirguna brahman (without attributes) and saguna brahman (with attributes). His was a monistic teaching that stressed that saguna brahman was a lesser, temporary form of nirguna brahman. He taught also that the self (atman) is identical with nirguna brahman and that through knowledge of this unity the cycle of rebirth can be broken.   

The Upanishads were composed during a time of much social, political, and economic upheaval. Rural tribal society was disappearing, and the adjustments of the people to urban living under a monarchy probably provoked many psychological and religious responses. During this period many groups of mystics, world renouncers, and forest dwellers appeared in India, among whom were the authors of the Upanishads. The most important practices and doctrines of these world renouncers included asceticism and the concept of rebirth, or transmigration.

The Rigveda contains few examples of asceticism, except among the “silent ones” (munis). The Atharvaveda describes another class of religious adepts, or specialists, the vratyas, particularly associated with the region of Magadha (west-central Bihar). The vratya was a wandering hierophant (one who manifested the holy) who remained outside the system of Vedic religion. He practiced flagellation and other forms of self-mortification and traveled from place to place in a bullock cart with an apprentice and with a woman who appears to have engaged in ritual prostitution. The Brahmans sought to bring the vratyas into the Vedic system by special conversion rituals, and it may be that the vratyas introduced their own beliefs and practices into Vedic religion. At the same time, the more-complex sacrifices of the later Vedic period demanded purificatory rituals, such as fasting and vigil, as part of the preparations for the ceremony. Thus, there was a growing tendency toward the mortification of the flesh.

The origin and development of the belief in transmigration of souls are very obscure. A few passages suggest that this doctrine was known even in the days of the Rigveda, and the Brahmanas often refer to doctrines of re-death and rebirth, but it was first clearly propounded in the earliest Upanishad—the Brihadaranyka. There it is stated that the soul of a Vedic sacrificer returns to earth and is reborn in human or animal form. This doctrine of samsara (reincarnation) is attributed to the sage Uddalaka Aruni, who is said to have learned it from a Kshatriya chief. In the same text, the doctrine of karma (“actions”), according to which the soul achieves a happy or unhappy rebirth according to its works in the previous life, occurs for the first time and is attributed to the theologian Yajnavalkya. Both doctrines seem to have been new, circulating among small groups of ascetics who were disinclined to make them public, perhaps for fear of the orthodox priests. These doctrines must have spread rapidly, for they appear in the later Upanishads and in the earliest Buddhist and Jain scriptures.
    
**Buddhism:** Buddhism, religion and philosophy that developed from the teachings of the Buddha (Sanskrit: “Awakened One”), a teacher who lived in northern India between the mid-6th and mid-4th centuries bce (before the Common Era). Spreading from India to Central and Southeast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan, Buddhism has played a central role in the spiritual, cultural, and social life of Asia, and, beginning in the 20th century, it spread to the West.

Ancient Buddhist scripture and doctrine developed in several closely related literary languages of ancient India, especially in Pali and Sanskrit. In this article Pali and Sanskrit words that have gained currency in English are treated as English words and are rendered in the form in which they appear in English-language dictionaries. Exceptions occur in special circumstances—as, for example, in the case of the Sanskrit term dharma (Pali: dhamma), which has meanings that are not usually associated with the term dharma as it is often used in English. Pali forms are given in the sections on the core teachings of early Buddhism that are reconstructed primarily from Pali texts and in sections that deal with Buddhist traditions in which the primary sacred language is Pali. Sanskrit forms are given in the sections that deal with Buddhist traditions whose primary sacred language is Sanskrit and in other sections that deal with traditions whose primary sacred texts were translated from Sanskrit into a Central or East Asian language such as Tibetan or Chinese.

**Non-theistic**  

While some Buddhists believe in deities, Buddhism is usually considered a nontheistic religion because the main focus is on following a moral and ethical code outlined by the Eight-Fold Path. Some Buddhists believe in and worship deities, but the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, is not considered a deity because he was simply the guru who helped teach about the truth for finding enlightenment.

**Four Noble Truths**

In Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths (Sanskrit: चत्वार्यार्यसत्यानि, romanized: catvāryāryasatyāni; Pali: cattāri ariyasaccāni; "The Four arya satya") are "the truths of the noble one (the Buddha),"[a][b] a statement of how things really are when they are seen correctly.[1][note 1] The four truths are

dukkha (not being at ease, 'suffering',[note 2] from dush-stha, standing unstable).[2][3][4][5] Dukkha is an innate characteristic of transient existence;[web 1][c][6] nothing is forever, this is painful;
samudaya (origin, arising, combination; 'cause'): together with this transient world and its pain, there is also thirst, craving for and attachment to this transient, unsatisfactory existence;[web 2][d][7][e][9]
nirodha (cessation, ending, confinement): the attachment to this transient world and its pain can be severed or contained by the confinement[8][9] or letting go of this craving;[10][11][f][12]
marga (road, path, way): the Noble Eightfold Path is the path leading to the confinement of this desire and attachment, and the release from dukkha.[g][13][14]

The four truths grew to be of central importance in the Theravada tradition of Buddhism by about the 5th-century CE,[38][39] which holds that the insight into the four truths is liberating in itself.[40] They are less prominent in the Mahayana tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into sunyata, emptiness, and following the Bodhisattva path as central elements in their teachings and practice.[41] The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world".[42] Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by western colonialists in the 19th century and the development of Buddhist modernism, they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism,[43][44] sometimes with novel modernistic reinterpretations very different from the historic Buddhist traditions in Asia.[45][46][47]

**Eightfold Path**

Eightfold Path, in Buddhism, an early formulation of the path to enlightenment. The idea of the Eightfold Path appears in what is regarded as the first sermon of the founder of Buddhism, Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, which he delivered after his enlightenment. There he sets forth a middle way, the Eightfold Path, between the extremes of asceticism and sensual indulgence. Like the Sanskrit term Chatvari-arya-satyani, which is usually translated as Four Noble Truths, the term Astangika-marga also implies nobility and is often rendered as the “Eightfold Noble Path.” Similarly, just as what is noble about the Four Noble Truths is not the truths themselves but those who understand them, what is noble about the Eightfold Noble Path is not the path itself but those who follow it. Accordingly, Astangika-marga might be more accurately translated as the “Eightfold Path of the [spiritually] noble.” Later in the sermon, the Buddha sets forth the Four Noble Truths and identifies the fourth truth, the truth of the path, with the Eightfold Path. Each element of the path also is discussed at length in other texts.

**Belief in Karma**

The term karma (Sanskrit: कर्म; Pali: kamma) refers to both the executed 'deed, work, action, act' and the 'object, intent'.[3]

Wilhelm Halbfass (2000) explains karma (karman) by contrasting it with the Sanskrit word kriya:[3] whereas kriya is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, karma is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars[10] as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.[3]

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of karma arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth to be essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction.[11] Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus, karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings.[12] It is a concept whose meaning, importance, and scope varies between the various traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. Wendy O'Flaherty claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.[13]

The concept of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism),[6] as well as Taoism.[7] In these schools, karma in the present affects one's future in the current life as well as the nature and quality of future lives—one's saṃsāra.[8][9] This concept has also been adopted in Western popular culture, in which the events that happen after a person's actions may be considered natural consequences of those actions.

**Rebirth**

Buddhists believe that when someone dies, they will be reborn again as something else. What they are reborn as depends on their actions in their previous life (kamma
). The cycle of rebirth is called samsara and it is an ongoing cycle of life, death and rebirth.
Humans go through an unknown number of cycles of rebirth over many lifetimes. Skilful actions lead to a good rebirth and unskilful actions lead to a bad rebirth. Through doing skilful actions in their life, a person can be reborn into one of the six realms:

**1** the realm of the gods

**2** the realm of the angry gods

**3** the realm of the animals

**4** the realm of the tormented beings

**5** the realm of the hungry ghosts

**6** the realm of humans

Buddhists believe that the human realm is the best one to be in if they want to reach 
enlightenment. If they gain good kamma and follow the teachings of the Buddha, they will be reborn into a more preferable realm.

**Tipitaka**

Tipiṭaka (Pali: [tɪˈpɪʈɐkɐ]) or Tripiṭaka (Sanskrit: [trɪˈpɪʈɐkɐ]) , meaning "Triple Basket",[1] is the traditional term for ancient collections of Buddhist sacred scriptures.[1][2][3][4] The Tripiṭaka is composed of three main categories of texts that collectively constitute the Buddhist canon: the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Sutta Piṭaka, and the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.[5]

The Pāli Canon maintained by the Theravāda tradition in Southeast Asia, the Chinese Buddhist Canon maintained by the East Asian Buddhist tradition, and the Tibetan Buddhist Canon maintained by the Tibetan Buddhist tradition are some of the most important Tripiṭaka in contemporary Buddhist world.[2]

Tripiṭaka has become a term used for many schools' collections, although their general divisions do not match a strict division into three pitakas.

**Cultural Impacts:**

**Hinduism’s role in Shaping Indian art** 

Much Indian art illustrates the gods and spiritual figures of three major religions that developed in India. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism all teach their stories to the faithful through images.

In all three traditions, believers worship independently rather than gathered as a congregation. Works of art are the focus of their worship. With proper ritual care, some images and structures become a home for the deity itself. The more decoration at a temple or shrine, the more pleased the god honored there will be.

Art also helps worshippers imagine the world beyond the one they know. All three religions teach that the physical world is just an illusion. Studying an image can help one learn truths that cannot be grasped in the world we know. It is this knowledge that is most valuable to a believer, not the work of art itself.

Religious texts provide precise descriptions of how gods and the cosmic world they inhabit should appear. A work of art that does not follow these descriptions accurately cannot serve its purpose.

**Hinduism’s role in Shaping Literature**

In shaping the Indian identity and Indian literature Hinduism has played a central role it has been a treasure trove of diverse cultural expressions. The perceptions and interpretations of Hinduism of Indian poets offer unique understanding into the complexities and fine points of Indianness. The present study aims to explore how poets in Indian literature have presented Hinduism, suppling a deep insight of the religion's influence on the Indian psyche. The present study delves into the exploration of "Indianness" in Indian literature by the lens of Hinduism's profusive influence. Indian literature topography reflects a unique amalgamation of languages, religions, traditions, and perspectives, contributing to the heterogenous cultural identity of the nation. 

There are three main yearly festivals. All major festival celebrations include visiting a temple, eating special foods and exchanging gifts.

**Diwali** is the festival of lights. Light represents knowledge. It is celebrated in late October or early November. This is the Hindu New Year.

**Holi** is the festival which marks the coming of spring. It is held in March or April. There are processions and people light bonfires and cover each other with colored water and powders.

**Dussehra** is the festival which marks Rama's triumph over the evil Ravana. It is held in September. There are dances and plays with events in the life of the god Rama depicted.

Every twelve years in January or February:

**Kumbha Mela:** This celebration is a huge bathing affair. Millions of Hindu pilgrims go to the River Ganges at Allahbad for this festival.


**Buddhism's influence on meditation practices**   mindfulness movements in Asia and the West.

Cognitive and neuroscience research from the past several years has shed new light on the influences that meditative traditions have on the meditation practice. Here we review new evidence that shows that types of meditation that developed out of certain traditions such as Vajrayana and Hindu Tantric lead to heightened sympathetic activation and phasic alertness, while types of meditation from other traditions such as Theravada and Mahayana elicit heightened parasympathetic activity and tonic alertness. Such findings validate Buddhist scriptural descriptions of heightened arousal during Vajrayana practices and a calm and alert state of mind during Theravada and Mahayana types of meditation and demonstrate the importance of the cultural and philosophical context out of which the meditation practices develop.

**Buddhism's influence on Art**
Buddhist art is visual art produced in the context of Buddhism. It includes depictions of Gautama Buddha and other Buddhas and bodhisattvas, notable Buddhist figures both historical and mythical, narrative scenes from their lives, mandalas, and physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture.[1] Buddhist art originated in the north of the Indian subcontinent, in modern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the earliest survivals dating from a few centuries after the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama from the 6th to 5th century BCE.As Buddhism spread and evolved in each new host country, Buddhist art followed in its footsteps. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with Hindu and Jain art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.[2]

Initially the emphasis was on devotional statues of the historical Buddha, as well as detailed scenes in relief of his life, and former lives, but as the Buddhist pantheon developed devotional images of bodhisattvas and other figures became common subjects in themselves in Northern Buddhist art, rather than just attendants of the Buddha, and by the late first millennium came to predominate.

**Buddhism's influence on Architecture**

Buddhism is a religion having its origin in Indian soil, which cherished and spread to different parts of the world. With the decease of Lord Buddha different forms of Architectural structures were erected to mark the burial place for Buddha and create a place of worship for followers of Buddhism. These structures were built using traditional material like mud, burnt bricks and stone which has close resemblance to Hinduism and Hindu Architecture as far as choice of material for construction is concerned. The Buddhist Architecture received recognition with development of places of worship which were more ornate and built forms as large domes with cardinal entrance points. Basically three important types of structures were built and used by followers of Buddhism namely Stupa, Chaitya halls and Viharas. Stupa were erected to preserve relics (leftover) of Lord Gautama Buddha, Chaitya halls were large congregational spaces meant for group prayers and worship which some times housed stupa, Viharas were monasteries constructed of bricks or excavated out of rocks where monks stayed and studied in cells built for them. This paper attempts to study how the origin and growth of a new religion, lead to evolution and development of new types of architecture in India. Such an assessment will help to ascertain relationship between structural-form development and with growth of religion and impact of religion on architectural development. 

Since the beginning of the twentieth century mindfulness has been positioned at the core of modern Buddhism and viewed by many modern interpreters as an essential component of Buddhist doctrine and practices. More recently, the practice of mindfulness has become rapidly popularised, radically secularised and removed from its Buddhist context, employed mainly as a therapeutic tool or applied for the enhancement of well-being. This paper examines the concept of mindfulness using an historical lens, aiming to identify some of the main parameters and consequent implications involved in the changes and developments of this Buddhist contemplative method—from its early beginnings over 2,500 years ago to the present day. Special attention is given to the historical developments in the colonial period, when various Buddhist traditions encountered the main European discourses of the time, resulting in the birth of modern Buddhism. In this period, particularly in Burma, meditation was positioned at the centre of Buddhist teachings and thus provided the grounds and conditions for the subsequent popularisation and secularisation of mindfulness in the late twentieth century. Through an examination of the concept of mindfulness through history, the paper explores whether a critical awareness of historical facts provides a better understanding of the current ubiquity of mindfulness practices worldwide. In addition, mindfulness has recently become an object of scientific research and, hence, it is important to investigate it in different contexts and discourses throughout history, and understand the implications of various definitions, interpretations and applications of mindfulness for the development of modern research approaches and methodologies.

**Rituals and Practices:**

**Hinduism:** Devotion (Bhakti)
Devotion (bhakti) refers to both a practice and a path (mārga) towards salvation. Devotion entails total and unconditional surrender and selfless love towards a personal or chosen deity. In turn, the person becomes a devotee of their chosen god or goddess. The idea of bhakti encompasses all rituals related to worshipping or venerating deities, such as worship (pūjā) and service (sevā). Bhakti is a practice open to all Hindus regardless of their caste, life station or gender.


Worship (Pūjā)
Worship (pūjā) is one of the most central practices in Hinduism. Every form of worship consists of making offerings and receiving blessings, from elaborate temple rituals to simple home practices. The frequency, scale and exact details of a pūjā depend on the nature and location of the deity, the connected texts or ritual manuals, the intention of the participants and the occasion for the worship. Home rituals are usually adopted as part of one’s daily routine and performed without the expertise of a priest. Meanwhile, worship conducted at a temple is much more elaborate and may involve multiple people, such as a temple priest.


Some rituals that may occur include ‘seeing’ the deity (darśana), and chanting mantras. Other common elements include playing instruments, ringing bells, burning incense, gestures, prostrations, ceremoniously walking around the deity’s altar, and offerings (usually food, fresh flowers and light produced from ghee-soaked wicks, otherwise known as ārtī). During a pūjā at a temple, the worshipper may receive sweets or a blessing (prasāda), a thread tied to their wrist or coloured powder (usually red or orange turmeric) dotted on their forehead.


Rituals like puja, yoga, pilgrimages (e.g., to Varanasi), and festivals (e.g., Diwali, Holi).
